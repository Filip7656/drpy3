The defaults are very good for 5-inch quads.  The disadvantage of Kiss is that it has a smaller user base than Betaflight and it may be harder to find help from the community when you need assistance.  Kiss hardware, flight controllers and ESCs often times cost more than their betaflight and FlightOne counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FlightOne:  Advantages - The new FalcoX firmware is very easy to set up on your quad using the graphical OSD wizard.  No computer necessary.  The software has many presets from which you can choose to find which may work best for your quad.  The disadvantage of FlightOne is hardware availability.  Often times their FCs and ESCs aren't available.

Contrary to a lot of popular belief, it actually isn't a direct measurement of the RPMs at any given input voltage. There is an ancillary relationship between the velocity constant and the forward voltage relationship to RPMs, but there are a lot of other factors, such as bell rotational inertia (and anything else being driven), friction, and drive mechanics in the ESC that can impact the RPMs when the motor is actively being driven.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, the no-load RPMs per volt is a decent estimate of &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; if you aren't concerned with being extremely accurate. If you're always using the same ESC and power supply, to drive the motor it can still be a reliable comparative metric between specific motors, even if it might have some offset to the actual electrical Kv of the motor when measured via back EMF. For a thorough discussion on the different methods of measuring &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/constants/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;check out this article on Bavaria-Direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it needs to be pointed out that the torque and &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; don't have the relationship you might think. You can read a full article on the details over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miniquadtestbench.com/motors-and-torque.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;miniquadtestbench&lt;/a&gt;, but essentially the &lt;em&gt;torque constant&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Kt&lt;/em&gt; which is directly proportional to the &lt;em&gt;velocity constant&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt;) has to do with how much current a motor draws to produce torque, not how much torque a motor is capable of producing. This is a super important distinction. The torque the motor is capable of producing is defined by the internal resistance and the magnetic field strength at the stator. The field strength is defined by things like magnet strength rating (field density) thickness, and width/height, as well as the air-gap between the magnets and the stators (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-electrostatics/ee-electric-force-and-electric-field/a/ee-inverse-square-law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;remember the inverse square law&lt;/a&gt;). The winding resistance is defined by the length and gauge of the wire used, as well as the number of strands. Assuming we can create a winding of equal resistance at different &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; by tweaking the gauge wire or the number of strands used, we would have equal torque capacity on both motors, only the torque would cost more current to produce on higher &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there is a belief that high Kv motors produce less torque than low &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motors is that the maximum torque output is limited by the maximum output rating defined by the heat dissipation capacity of the motor, and usually listed in the manufacturer specifications as a wattage limit. Essentially the higher &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor will burn out sooner than the lower &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor as the torque load increases at maximum output.  However given a load that is within the power limits of both motors, a lower Kv motor will not produce better results (faster RPM changes or better handling of a given prop for instance) than a higher &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor with equivalent magnetic field strength and winding resistance. Also, throttle limiting the higher &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor to equivalent RPMs as the lower &lt;em&gt;Kv&lt;/em&gt; motor will produce extremely similar results, albeit with higher current spikes on rapid transitions where the difference in &lt;em&gt;Kt&lt;/em&gt; shows itself on higher torque demand.

Front Right and Back Left counterclockwise.  Make sure the props will create a downward thrust when spun in their corresponding directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 2.&lt;/strong&gt;  On standard rotation quads you will need to spin up each individual motor (eg in Betaflight configurator) and make sure it is spinning the proper direction.  See Issue 1. for which direction that should be.  To do this take off any propellers, connect to Betaflight and plug in a battery.  Go the Motors tab in Betaflight and read the warning and click the &quot;props are off&quot; slider.  Now slightly move up the slider for motor 1-4 one at a time and feel with your hand for proper direction.  If you find a motor going the wrong direction make a note of which one it is (there might be more than 1).  To change the direction of any motor use BLHeli configurator for BLheliS ESCs and BLheli Suite for BLHeli32 ESCs.  Google search this for more details on how to reverse the motor direction.  Alternatively, you can swap any two motor wires at the ESC connection to change the direction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post has a very detailed explanation and diagrams &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/93/what-process-should-i-use-to-ensure-my-motors-are-spinning-the-correct-direction&quot;&gt;What process should I use to ensure my motors are spinning the correct direction when using Betaflight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 3:&lt;/strong&gt;  Look on your flight controller for an arrow pointing in a certain direction.  It should be pointing to the front of the quad. If it is not then this is probably your issue.  You can also confirm this issue by connecting your FC configurator (eg Betaflight) and looking at the setup screen where you should see a 3d model of a quad that moves around when you physically move the quad around.  If the movement of 3d model doesn't match how you move the physical quad then you have an alignment issue.  To fix you can either physically rotate the FC so that the arrow points forward or you can set a board rotation in the Betaflight configuration page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 4:&lt;/strong&gt;  To figure out if this is your issue, follow the motor spinning steps in the solution for Issue 2.  When spinning up a motor, make sure it's physical location matches the motor map picture in your configurator.  In Betaflight the order should be 1: Back Right, 2: Front Right, 3; Back Left, 4: Front Left.  If you move the slider for motor 1 and the Front right motor spins, you have a motor order problem.  This can happen if using a 4in1 ESC and two of the motor signal wires got swapped or if the ESC has a motor order that doesn't match what Betaflight expects.  The easiest way to fix is to change the motor signal wires so that the order is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="138" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T04:05:23.610" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T04:05:23.610" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is an easy mistake to make and always worth a check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next thing to check is that all of your motors are working correctly. Start by spinning each of the motors by hand and see if anything fella obviously wrong, for example, a magnet out of place. If nothing feels wrong, remove the props and individually spin up the motors in Betaflight to test them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next port of call is your gyro. Plug your quad into Betaflight or whatever firmware you use and move it around - does the virtual representation of the quad match up with your movements in real life? If not, that is almost certainly the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now make sure the motors spin in the correct direction and the correct position to match the graphic on your configurator by using the motors tab with the propellers off&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all of these have failed, swap two of your motors and see if the quad flips in the same direction. If the problem follows the motor, you have a faulty motor. If the problem stays in the same place, you likely have a faulty ESC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your ESC is not faulty and your motors are also fine, it is also possible that your resource mapping is incorrect. In the Betaflight CLI, type ‘resource’ and ensure that the correct pin from the microcontroller is assigned to the correct motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should also check that your motor direction is correct in Betaflight, and your motors are spinning in the expected directions in real life.

It's completely expected and normal with props off, and will be fine when you put props on and go fly! Almost everyone new to RC multirotors asks this question on their first build, so don't feel bad!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Detailed Answer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The detailed answer to this question is related to how multirotors maintain stability in flight. Multirotors use a control system called a PID controller. This is a feedback loop control that takes information from the sensors onboard the flight controller and then executes change via the motors based on how the commanded input is different from what it is sensing. For more information check &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/06/pid-theory-explained.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this white paper from the national instruments lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand this problem, the component of the PID controller we need to examine is the I constant, often referred to as &lt;em&gt;Ki&lt;/em&gt;. Essentially this is based on the integral calculation between the sensed value and the setpoint or target value. What this means is that I get stronger the longer there is a difference between the sensed value and the target value. Hence change over time. What you're seeing as the motors slowly spin-up is the buildup of that Ki value getting stronger and stronger as flight controller is trying harder and harder to execute a change that it can sense, but can't impact. No props means no force to execute change, hence the windup.  This is often referred to as I term windup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaefeQtA1c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here is an excellent video from Joshua Bardwell on the topic&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T03:58:47.723" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T03:58:47.723" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The ones I have seen tend to be pretty low sample sizes and somewhat limited scope. What I did find that supported some experimental data directed at the type of lipos that get used for quadcopters was this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propwashed.com/lipo-storage-voltage/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.propwashed.com/lipo-storage-voltage/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR from that is the study did not find any real difference between a lipo stored at any normal voltage level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, I have seen another study someone did with a slightly larger sample size (5-10 batteries over several months), but I can't seem to dig it up right now. The conclusion that the study had (from my recollection) was that storage at full (4.2v) or empty (3.5v) had an impact on the battery similar to single-digit charge cycles (fully charging, then fully discharging the battery) per week. Take this with a grain of salt, but from my memory, a fully charged battery stored for a week was roughly equivalent to 2-3 additional charge cycles, while a fully discharged battery was roughly equivalent to 5-6 charge cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal approach is to not worry about it too much. The only battery I've seen significant damage to from storage was left at empty for almost a year and had discharged well below 3v/cell. Typically I charge my batteries to fully charged if I'm planning a flight session in the next couple days, and storage charge them otherwise. This is less than ideal if I needed absolute performance out of them, but I'm not a pro racer who needs that, and essentially all the batteries I've retired have been due to crash damage, not degradation over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To that end, I'd recommend whatever best fits your flight style. Most data I've seen shows a lipo will generally last 300-400 charge cycles, so cutting that by 25% due to keeping them at full charge all the time seems like a reasonable trade-off if it means you're more easily able to get out and fly when you want to. If you're in a situation where you can easily charge from storage-&gt;full prior to ever flight session, keep them at storage and enjoy the extra lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="152" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T04:28:54.080" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T04:28:54.080" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

To check that the displayed and actual directions match, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Betaflight go to the motors tab, read the warnings, then plug in your battery and click the enable motors switch. Run up the motors one at a time from their slider and ensure they match the direction and position of the charts above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have access to a computer, alternatively you can simply arm your quad &lt;strong&gt;without props on&lt;/strong&gt; and check the direction that way.

  <row Id="156" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="12" CreationDate="2020-04-15T05:32:09.417" Score="6" Body="&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right motor can be a challenge. Unfortunately, the short answer to your question is no, there is not a simple formula for choosing a motor for a UAV. It's going to take some research regardless. This question is fairly open-ended, so I'll try to cover a few approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Identify Your Goals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to identify is the purpose of your craft. Are you looking to lift and transport a payload, are you interested in smooth controlled flight for aerial photography, or are you wanting to go fast and have immediate control and responsiveness? Each purpose for a multi-rotor is going to have extremely different approaches to the power train. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of what you need to analyze is how important several key variables are to your needs. The core needs are flight time (efficiency), speed, and handling. Where your needs fit along those spectrums will impact your motor choices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Translating to Powertrain Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The variables in the powertrain that correlate will be motor stator size and performance design characteristics, prop size, and battery voltage and capacity. Sorry nice this question was specific to motors I'll leave off the battery capacity component, but voltage is related to motor selection, so we do have to discuss the battery to a certain extent in conjunction with the motor choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few rules of thumb when it comes to powertrain selection. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more weight you need to lift, the larger the prop you will need to lift it efficiently. Essentially the loading of the effective disc area of the prop is proportional to efficiency. The larger the prop also the larger the motor that will be needed to be able to spin it effectively and the lower the relative Kv of the motor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also an inverse relationship between the size of the motor and the efficiency of the motor. If you're going for efficiency, you'll want to use the smallest motor that can effectively spin the size prop needed for your payload weight. If you're going for maximized lift capacity, control, smoothness or immediacy of response, you'll want to find a balance more towards a larger motor that is somewhat under-propped.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The larger the motor the more torque it is capable of producing, so going up in stator size and other motor performance metrics such as magnet strength, narrower air-gaps between the stator and the magnets, lower resistance windings, all play a role in the level of control the multi-rotor is able to enforce. In general, the higher the torque of the motor, the more control the motor can exert over a given prop, both in terms of the maximum rate of change of RPMs and the maximum reachable RPMs as a percentage of the no-load RPMs of the motor (typically defined as Kv times the applied voltage)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when it comes to multi-rotor UAVs, maximum static thrust is not the only (or even necessarily the primary) indicator of how suitable a motor is for a given application. The more important component to consider is actually how quickly the motor can change the RPMs of the propeller. If your primary goals are heavy lifting for the physical size (high disc loading) then it is much closer to static load conditions, and maximum thrust is a much better metric. In any case, where you are looking for smoothness or control, the rate of change is more important than the static output. There is often a relationship between high static thrust and torque, however, which is why many freestyle and race quads are often a 10:1 or greater power to weight ratio even if they rarely use the full range of the throttle. Higher torque means more control and more immediate response beyond just maximum speed. It also means more authority for the PID controllers that are being used to stabilize and direct the craft. However a larger motor with a lower Kv and lower thrust can sometimes produce better results than a smaller higher Kv motor that produces more thrust bust changes RPMs much less quickly, so some fine-tuning is necessary beyond the simple thrust to weight calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that thrust and speed don't always equate either. If you're looking to go fast, you will often get more speed out of a bi-blade prop that generates less thrust than a tri-blade that generates more thrust but spins at lower RPMs. This has to do with the way the pitch of the prop moves through the air as the craft moves forward. Also, a large low Kv motor that generates a lot of static thrust will not necessarily be faster than a smaller higher Kv motor that generates less static thrust but achieves higher RPMs in the air. Even on the same prop the lower Kv motor often will not be as fast due to the differences between static and dynamic loads (varying angle of attack). The larger lower Kv motor may hit higher RPMs under static load due to the higher torque, but the lower torque but higher Kv motor may hit higher RPMs when the load reduces in forward flight. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voltage is another critical component as it impacts the motor Kv range that is applicable for a given prop size. Choosing a voltage is also dependent on your application. Higher voltage is typically needed when disc loading (lift capacity), power consumption needs, or speed needs increase. If efficiency is a goal, lower voltages should be considered. There is a lot more to that discussion in terms of the electrical losses vs the battery chemistry gains of different cell counts under different applications, but that is a bit outside the scope of this question, so I'll merely say that the higher the voltage chosen, the lower the Kv for a given prop size, and the lower the voltage the higher the Kv. You can calculate the conversion by simple multiplication, if you have a combination you know works well on 4 cells and you want to switch to a 6 cell lipo, simply multiply the existing Kv by 3 the. Divide the answer by 6 to get the equivalent Kv at 6 cells. You can also use the nominal voltage of the batteries as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Kve * Ve)/Vt = Kvt &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Kve is the existing Kv,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Ve is the existing voltage (or cell count),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vt is the target voltage (or cell count),&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Kvt is the target Kv&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the manufacturer specifications will have a list of props that are suitable for a given motor, but often the sheets are not very specific, and their thrust and efficiency charts are all over the place in terms of comparable data. If possible find a third part testing website like www.miniquadtestbench.com, EngineerX on YouTube, or the Micro Motor Test Lab on Facebook. This will be extremely helpful in identifying the range of motors and props that might work well in your application. From there you can weigh the variables I've mentioned and make adjustments. If you can't find independent data, take the manufacturer data with a grain of salt as a general ballpark figure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, as mentioned elsewhere, this is all very specific to multi-rotor craft. Fixed-wing has very different considerations that are related to things like wrong loading, angle of attack, and airspeed, though some of the principles I mentioned do still apply. That's all a bit out of my wheelhouse though, so I'll leave that answer to someone with more experience and expertise in fixed-wing power systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="169" LastEditDate="2020-04-22T20:42:59.663" LastActivityDate="2020-04-22T20:42:59.663" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I recently ran into this issue with some of my setups. The RX was on 2.X.X firmware, which FrSky enabled some minor attempts at encryption to discourage unauthorized receivers and transmitters.  This firmware is NOT backward compatible with the 1.X.X radio firmware, so if your internal module on your transmitter is not updated to 2.X.X firmwares it WON'T bind. You will need to upgrade your internal radio module to the correct firmware as well.

You can add a small, powerful LED that allows some pretty fun exploration in dark and very tiny spaces without the risk of loosing a larger, more expensive piece of equipment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nga_KgekIsU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Example video of someone flying in their house with the lights out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A cinewhoop is a larger drone, more like 6-7 inches wide and weighing 200-400g, also with ducts. Typically it's called a cinewhoop because it's about the smallest thing you would want to fly that can comfortably carry a GoPro. You could equip this with a much more powerful light and have a real blast flying around. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/138/10&quot;&gt;tavis mentioned&lt;/a&gt; the DJI FPV system would be an excellent setup for caves as it has great video quality and is very resistant to signal multipathing which is a very common affliction of analog video systems like what you would install on a tiny whoop. Multipathing is likely to be a very real issue inside a cave. If you could live with the analog break up though there are few 'starlight' type analog cameras that can operate in very dark environments. However, I don't think that would be nearly as enjoyable or as useful as a 1000+ lumen flashlight strapped to a DJI equipped cinewhoop. That would be awesome. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkTwxIUtWbY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Video here of DRL pilot NURK doing a better job of explaining what a cinewhoop is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say your typical DJI consumer drone would not be well suited to a dark cave. Without GPS they would rely on downward-firing cameras for position hold which doesn't work in the dark. You could possibly rig up light to assist the cameras but I would guess that it still wouldn't work very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T03:56:10.013" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T03:56:10.013" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

That means the amount of power it costs to generate torque increase as Kv increases. A low torque constant means that less power is used to create torque, and a high torque constant means more power is used.  For more information on the torque constants and how they relate, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathworks.com/help/physmod/sps/ref/dcmotor.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this article over at MathWorks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To break this down, it means that as the Kv increases the RPMs the motor is trying to reach increases per volt of applied electricity. But that also means that the power required to reach those RPMs is proportionally greater as voltage increases assuming a constant Kv. Effectively a motor of higher Kv will burn itself out trying to reach those RPMs very quickly. If it doesn't burn it will likely put significant strain on the rest of your electrical system as the current draw increases, both the battery and the speed controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you effectively limit the maximum RPMs of the motor, there is not a major loss for running higher Kv motors, as it effectively limits the maximum current draw which is what presents the problem.

Example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A 4S (15V to make math easy) battery will turn a 2000kV motor at 30,000RPM (with no load, inefficiencies, etc)&#xA;a 6S (20V) battery will need a 1500kV motor to achieve the same RPM&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory, the result is the same amount of power (watts) required to achieve the same RPM/power output/etc. A 4S 2000kV motor will draw say 20 amps, or 300 watts. To get the same power output, a 6S 1500kV motor will draw 15 amps (still 300 watts), and spin at the same RPM. Higher voltage but lower current generally results in less heat, because of ohm's law. Current creates energy loss over resistances (ESC components have internal (small) resistance, which is why they heat up, which is why they have a current rating in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Bardwell's videos go into the details of 4S vs 6S, but they work out to be pretty much the same. The reason larger models go with higher voltages (and lower kV to achieve the desired RPM) is because they are much higher wattage, and achieving that higher wattage strictly with higher current is unrealistic (Large scale planes would be drawing 500-600 amps at 3-4S voltages, dangerous and expensive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To reference an earlier comment, the voltage &quot;rating&quot; of the motor is just the suggested voltage.

If you have a very intensive low-latency connection, typically try to avoid use softserial. Softserial is best suited to things like VTX control (smart audio and tramp protocol, etc), GPS, and smart-port telemetry, where latency, speed, or loss of signal during flight isn't an issue. While it can be used for other more system critical links like RC control, I would generally recommend against it, though it is theoretically possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sources:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oscarliang.com/betaflight-soft-serial/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://oscarliang.com/betaflight-soft-serial/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multirotorguide.com/guide/guide-how-to-set-up-the-softserial-uart/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.multirotorguide.com/guide/guide-how-to-set-up-the-softserial-uart/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2020-04-15T20:12:47.400" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

As you probably know, radio waves are a subtype of electromagnetic waves, which in turn are nothing more than alternating electrical and magnetic fields in space. The laws of this universe dictate that a changing electric field creates a (perpendicular) magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field will create an (also perpendicular) electric field. This allows the two fields to feed on each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the most common picture of an EM wave that you have probably seen is something like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJw6H.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJw6H.png&quot; alt=&quot;A linearly polarized wave&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;linearly polarized&lt;/em&gt; wave.&#xA;Here, the electric field is red and the magnetic field is blue. Each of those always oscillates in a particular direction (e.g. the electric field vertically and the magnetic horizontally). This kind of wave is typically generated with straight antennae, in which electrons move back and forth along the antenna and thus generate the linearly-oscillating electric field. The wave on the picture is vertically polarized (The polarization direction is the electric field's orientation) and was probably generated by a vertically oriented antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While an antenna only generates waves of its corresponding polarization, it can receive differently polarized waves, as long as the electrons inside the antenna can move in the same direction that the electric field of the wave is oscillating.&#xA;For example, an antenna oriented at 45° relative to the incoming wave's polarization, will still receive the signal, as it is still oscillating &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; in the same direction, just (1.41 times) weaker: the electrons in the antenna can still be moved up and down by the wave, as long as they're also moving side to side so that they could stay within the antenna. In fact, the only situation in which such an antenna will &lt;em&gt;reject&lt;/em&gt; (not receive) a signal entirely is if the antenna is perpendicular to the polarization direction: electrons can't move vertically in a horizontal antenna at all. In all the other antenna positions will have varying strengths of reception (or &lt;em&gt;gains&lt;/em&gt;) depending on how much the directions differ (in mathematical terms, it's proportional to the inner product of the two directions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other main type of polarization is &lt;strong&gt;circular polarization&lt;/strong&gt;, in which the electric field does not just oscillate in one direction, but instead rotates around an axis (along which the wave travels), with the magnetic field following, forming a spiral as it propagates through space. A circularly-polarized signal can be thought of as a sum of two perpendicular linearly-polarized ones, one lagging a bit behind the other:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/INab7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/INab7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Circular-polarized wave as a sum of linearly polarized waves&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(note that the red and blue colors do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean electric and magnetic fields here, this is the same field viewed from two directions.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(for completeness, there is also elliptical polarization, which can be thought of as a sum of a circular and linear signal, or a sum of two linear signals that are not equally strong).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any rotation must have a direction (or &lt;em&gt;handedness&lt;/em&gt;), clockwise or counterclockwise, relative to the direction in which the wave is traveling. That is what distinguishes &lt;strong&gt;Right-hand circularly polarized&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;RHCP&lt;/strong&gt;) waves from &lt;strong&gt;Left-hand circularly polarized&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;LHCP&lt;/strong&gt;) ones. There are antennae specifically designed to emit and receive circularly-polarized waves, and they, too, must have one of the two possible directions. An RHCP antenna emits RHCP waves, and the same is true for LHCP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reception is more complicated. A linear antenna would receive circularly-polarized signals no problem, in any orientation (except if pointed directly at the signal's source), since, as we discussed, exactly half of that signal's power is linearly polarized in the antenna's direction (and the other half perpendicularly, so that part is rejected, hence the gain is 1/2 or lower). The opposite is also true: a circularly-polarized antenna of either handedness will happily receive (though at no more than half gain) any linearly polarized signal (which is half of a circularly polarized one).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The one kind of signal a circularly polarized antenna will reject is a signal of the opposite handedness.&lt;/strong&gt; an RHCP antenna will refuse to receive an LHCP signal, and vice-versa. And that is the main reason why these antennae are used in FPV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bane of video signals in industrial and other environments rich in RF-reflecting surfaces is &lt;em&gt;multipath propagation&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;multipathing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, as it's more commonly known. This is a situation in which the transmitted signal, besides a direct line of sight path, gets received via reflections from nearby surfaces. Since the reflected signal takes a longer path, it gets to your goggles a bit later than the direct signal. This delay is enough for the very fast scan rate of analog video to go forward several pixels, so overlaying this delayed signal (of which there are usually several) on top of the original one produces severe distortions in the image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good thing for us about reflected signals, however, is that a circularly polarized wave reverses its handedness whenever it bounces off of something, so a reflected RHCP wave becomes LHCP and vice versa (as the direction of travel changes, while the direction of rotation stays the same), which means that the antenna will reject all reflections (it will not reject double reflections, which will have the original polarization, but those are weaker than single ones).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus is that it allows sharing bandwidth better if pilots on close channels fly opposite-handed signals, as possible interference from the neighboring band will be rejected by one's receiving antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as the difference between RHCP vs LHCP goes, as you can see, neither is better than the other physically, they are two sides of the same coin.&#xA;However, in actual practice there &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; differences if you don't fly alone. Historically, RHCP has been several times more common than LHCP, and that means two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With an RHCP antenna, you can spectate almost anyone, and they can spectate you, while with an LHCP antenna it's far less likely both ways (although one can spectate both kinds of circular polarization with a linear antenna and face the multipathing).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's easier to get interference from others (and cause interference to them) if you're flying the same polarization, so RHCP is going to be generally noisier and more interference-prone for everyone around.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not racing, the second point probably doesn't matter, just move a couple of channels away. If you are, you should probably have both RHCP and LHCP antennae with you and be ready to switch as directed by the organizers.&#xA;Still, even if you're not a racer, it can be worth having a couple of LHCP antennae in your flight bag for when a lot of people are in the air; you'll get a much cleaner signal that way (and they will, too)!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some receiving antennae, such as the Triple-feed patch, can be either RHCP or LHCP depending on where you attach the feedline. Those can be worth having if you can't decide or switch polarizations often, or just to reduce the number of antennae to own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-10-29T09:29:19.160" LastActivityDate="2020-10-29T09:29:19.160" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Also, I would imagine, you wouldn't want to risk flying into walls (or people). So, if you need just a tool for exploring the walls and indentations of larger caverns, the best drone would be very compact in transportation, waterproof, stable and have a collision-avoidance system. A controllable camera gimbal is a big bonus for looking in different directions while hovering in place. That feature set suggests something in the Mavic line of DJI drones since they have all of it. They are compact, foldable, rugged, waterproof, stabilized, gimbal-equipped and collision-avoiding. If you want a recon drone, that would be it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, while DJI drones can be flown indoors (and even have a special &quot;tripod mode&quot; that limits their forward speed), there seem to be some quirks with the position-stabilized modes there. Optical stabilization can fail in darker environments, the drone may wander around erratically for some seconds if it acquires some satellites through a window, for example. If you keep to the attitude mode, however, you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, if all you need is a camera platform/reconnaissance drone, get a Mavic (one of the smaller ones probably) and mount some powerful LED lights on it. Also, a good idea may be to get some prop guards with it despite the collision avoidance just to be extra safe. You don't want to lose that many dollars (or cut your buddy with a prop) in a cave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to &lt;strong&gt;have fun&lt;/strong&gt; with the drone, that's another deal entirely.&#xA;Large caverns have been flown by freestyle and race pilots on several occasions with great success. Depending on the size of the cavern you expect to fly, you might want anything from a larger (75mm+) brushless micro quad to a 4-5 inch quadcopter for huge spaces. The most universal is probably something like an 85mm whoop. Prop guards are a good idea in any case, ducts are probably not if you're looking for performance. Conformal coating all electronics to protect them from moisture is a must. Still, be prepared for the possibility of losing the drone. Also, acrobatic drones are not very useful for looking over stuff in a hover due to the fixed camera uptilt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A digital video system is good for rejecting multipath signals in enclosed spaces, but note that all current digital systems are way bulkier than analog ones, so I'd probably go with a good analog transmitter and Rapidfire or similar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T03:56:54.790" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T03:56:54.790" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Take a look at this diagram: &lt;a href=&quot;https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharge_characteristics_li&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharge_characteristics_li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It tells you that the specific 3000mAh cell tested there loses around 30% of its capacity when discharged at 2C, which corresponds to around 6A, which is not much in terms of FPV flying. If you draw more current, the loss will be even greater. This is also true for LiPo batteries, but they're made for tens of amps of discharge, and the relevant effect will only manifest itself noticeably at discharge rates of, say, 30C.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saying that, you can discharge Li-Ion to much lower voltages than LiPo, typically to slightly below 3V instead of the typical 3.5V for Lipos (assuming you don't want to damage the cells or accept capacity loss). So you'd have to adjust your copter warnings/beepers accordingly. Data sheets and available discharge plots at &lt;a href=&quot;https://lygte-info.dk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://lygte-info.dk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://batteryuniversity.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://batteryuniversity.com&lt;/a&gt; mostly suggest to not go below 2.5V - 2.7V, if the lifetime of the cell is to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then weight is an issue. A typical 4S 1800 mAh LiPo weighs in around 200g, so you get 9 mAh/g. A modern high-current Li-Ion 18650 cell such as the Sony US18650VTC5A with 2600 mAh weighs 48g, so you get 2600 mAh / (4 * 48g) = 13.5 mAh/g. Now if you take into account a small capacity loss because you're discharging the Li-Ion at 10A ~ 4C (flying very carefully!) you'd probably end up with 2200 mAh or 11.5 mAh / g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A potential way out of this is, of course, to use more 18650 cells to make a 4S2p pack, which would half the discharge rate per cell and therefore give you not only more capacity in total (2 x 2600 mAh = 5200 mAh), but you'd also get closer to the nominal cell capacity because the 10A you're discharging at are ~ 2C and not ~4C as for a 4S1p pack. But then again you'd carry around a 8 x 48g = 384g battery, which would probably feel noticeably more sluggish than a 200g battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Samsung INR 21700-40T (this is not a 18650, but it's slightly larger!) has a capacity of 4000 mAh, can deliver 40A and weighs 70g, resulting in 4000 mAh / 280g = 14.3 mAh / g when assembled in a 4S1p pack. Discharging this at 20A to 3V results in a capacity of 3300 mAh, or 11.8 mAh/g. This might be a viable option for a long-range copter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while Li-Ion batteries probably are the next best option compared to LiPo, they can't compete in racing or acrobatics, but they may outperform LiPos in long-range situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="281" LastEditorUserId="281" LastEditDate="2020-04-16T11:29:26.123" LastActivityDate="2020-04-16T11:29:26.123" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The VTX sends out radio-frequency (RF) energy through the antenna connector and pigtail, and if nothing (or the wrong thing) is connected at the other end, all the energy gets reflected back and could damage your VTX (or just heat it up).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At high frequencies a thing called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_matching&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;impedance matching&lt;/a&gt;&quot; becomes very important. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, when a radio wave travels through a wire, the wire presents a certain &lt;em&gt;impedance&lt;/em&gt; (a more &quot;generalized&quot; form of resistance) to the signal. Whenever the travelling wave encounters a change in this impedance as it goes through the cable, connectors and other hardware, i.e. it was 50 ohms before a certain connector and becomes 75 ohms after, part of the wave gets reflected back at that point, and the bigger the mismatch, the bigger the percentage that gets reflected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any properly designed antenna will have the same impedance (in the frequency range that it was designed for, i.e. 5.8 GHz for a video antenna) as the coaxial cable before it, and dissipate the received radio-frequency energy by radiating it out in the form of radio waves, thus nothing gets reflected towards the VTX. However, If there is nothing at the end of your pigtail, the mismatch is as big as it can possibly be, since nothing connected means infinite resistance. Thus &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the power that the VTX emits gets reflected back towards it and has nowhere to go other than to heat it up. If the VTX is poorly designed, the reflected power could even burn some of the components in it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this gets more important with the more powerful VTXes. If you've got a 25 mW or even a 200 mW VTX, it's probably not going to damage itself if left without an antenna for a while (although you better not risk it anyway). An 800+ mW VTX could do much more damage; in the best case it will just get very very hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really need to run without an antenna for some reason (which is rare, but possible if you're testing something that needs the VTX to be powered up, but don't want to actually transmit anything), there is an option to terminate the transmission line with a &quot;dummy load&quot; (which is just an powerful resistor that's impedance-matched to the coax and dissipates all the RF power that it gets) instead of an antenna. Note that shorting the connector is also going to reflect all the power back to the VTX; zero resistance is no better than infinite resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, beware of antennae that are designed for other frequency ranges. i.e. a 2.4 GHz antenna from your router or radio control might look like it's compatible and will probably even have the same (SMA or RP-SMA) connector, so it'll fit mechanically just fine, but at 5.8 GHz it will have a drastically different impedance and thus transmit only a small portion of the power it receives, with the rest being – you guessed it! – reflected back and heating up your VTX. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-17T09:27:53.417" LastActivityDate="2020-04-17T09:27:53.417" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Mathematically, the quadcopter provides the lowest number of simple actuators that accomplish the job. Each actuator can work by simply speeding up or slowing down, whereas helicopters and tricopters require some other kind of actuation, usually a complex one. It turns out from a pragmatic viewpoint &lt;em&gt;speeding up and slowing down motors is much more robust than changing angles of spinning blades&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Quadcopter&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Formally, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZY4ut.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZY4ut.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quadcopter for Qids&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So quadcopters reign over helicopters and tripcoters because they're simple. Each axis is controlled by a certain combination of motor speeds and all axes are independent, i.e. when you increase thrust you don't have to also worry about changing the pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why not hexas, octos, etc...?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Hexacopters&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hexas can lift more, but provide no additional safety margin because there is no way to stabilize all four axes when an arbitrary motor goes out (there are certain configurations which can continue to fly if one motor out of a set of four fails, but cannot fly if either of the other two fail).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hexas also are less efficient, since they use smaller propellers. (Without diving into blade theory, and simplifying somewhat, the most efficient blade is a single blade which is infinitely large and moving infinitely slowly.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hexas also have 6 motors for four degrees of freedom, so when they're all flat you get what is called an &quot;overconstrained&quot; system.

This happens because the typical octo is loaded past the point where 4 motors can carry it safely. However, certain high-value vehicles, such as those carrying expensive cameras, are octos because it's cheaper to over-spec the octo's batteries and motors than it is to replace a $50k camera.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Octos are also less efficient, for the same reason as hexas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastEditorUserId="13" LastEditDate="2020-04-16T22:20:17.797" LastActivityDate="2020-04-16T22:20:17.797" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Think, for example, why helicopters have a propeller at the end of their tail boom; they need to counteract the rotational forces of the main prop (in a system, momentum must be conserved so  without the tail boom, the rotor on top would cause the main airframe to rotate to counter the motion proportional to its mass).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to counteract this, you need the rotational inertia of the props to sum to zero to avoid motion, such as by having an even number of propellers, or you need a way to vector part of the thrust to counteract this motion, which you can see in tricopters where they have a servo on one of the rotors. This adds extra complication and points of failure, so it’s easier to go with an even number of rotors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reading that we have four instead of two rotors is that, as well as yaw, we also need to think about the pitch and roll axes. For a bicopter. If you want to yaw, you either need to vector the thrust, or decrease the speed of one of the directions of propellers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The former of these requires servos which, again, adds extra complications, and the latter means that there is an imbalance of thrust, which will cause unwanted pitch or roll, depending on the orientation of the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, on a quadcopter, these problems disappear. We can have the rotation of each diagonal set of props matching each other. If we want to yaw, we increase the thrust in one set and decrease it in another. If we want to pitch or roll, we can decrease the thrust in adjacent props and increase the thrust in the other two, both while maintaining inertia and having no yaw motion (see the diagram below). We also have the added benefit of more thrust so a greater payload.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This can be scaled up with the same principle to aircraft with any even number of propellers so that there is redundancy - if one motor or prop fails, the others can compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question - please feel free to ask for clarification on anything you think I may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kv0ld.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kv0ld.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An illustration of the movement of a drone’s rotors&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested how an aircraft with an odd number of motors doesn’t need servos, I’ve found this interesting paper from MIT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/taodu/pentacopter_guide/guide.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://people.csail.mit.edu/taodu/pentacopter_guide/guide.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photo source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Inertial-and-body-fixed-frame-of-the-quadrotors-For-modeling-the-physics-of-the-quadrotor_fig2_331413393/amp&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Inertial-and-body-fixed-frame-of-the-quadrotors-For-modeling-the-physics-of-the-quadrotor_fig2_331413393/amp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="50" LastEditDate="2020-04-16T20:34:56.607" LastActivityDate="2020-04-16T20:34:56.607" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Anecdotally, you can hear these ripples, especially when comparing power tools using universal motors (i.e. brushed AC wound in series) vs BLDC. Sounds represents energy, all other things being equal a noisier drive is a less efficient drive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brushless motors also are easily built into outrunner applications, which is appropriate for high-torque direct drive applications, such as a propeller. An inrunner needs an inefficient gearbox to develop the torque required to spin a blade (which might also be complex, costly, and weighty).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An oftentimes overlooked consequence of brushless efficiency is heat generation. Fundamentally, what limits a motor's power is heat, and producing less of it means that more energy can be supplied from a smaller package. The smaller package means lighter weight, which equates to longer-runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of these on its own is small, but summed together they result in a far superior drone operation from brushless than brushed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[*] There are some extremely efficient (&gt;95%) brushed motors out there.

A single over or under charge as long as it's not extreme in nature is probably insignificant as the chemistry on not an exact science inside the pack.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found that as users of lipos there's really only a few things we can do to preserve them and get the most out of are purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's my experience:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My home is my flying field so I used to like to fly very early in the morning as the lighting and wind was often most favorable.  So, I'd charge my batteries the night before and have the ready at dawn when I wanted to fly.  This resulted in my keeping them charged nearly all the time during the flying season.  So, those lipos (3S 6400 Venom 20C) literally lasted 1 year and they started to puff and voltage sag.  I never over charged them, and never 'undervolted' them.  No physical abuse.  Just normal flying, no crashes, damage etc.  Just the charging habit was the sole factor in their short life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I replaced them with 4 packs of the same quality, but instead NEVER left them full charged for more than a few hours, often not even that much.  I also immediately storage charged them after use.  I now charge them right before flying only and never the day before.  the quad is the same, the conditions are the same and those batteries are now 3+ years old and none is puffed.  They are starting to sag a little but still working.  Will get this summer out of them then will replace.  I also switched to a high quality real skyrc d100 charger replacing my copycat/chinese $12 clone cheapo knockoff so-called b6ac.  Huge difference.  The knock off was all over the place on the voltages and not accurate at all.  Some charge cycles would come out 4.10v and others 4.35v with the same charge settings.  You really get what you pay for in a balance charger.  Get a good one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if they don't puff, you can tell they're getting tired because they voltage sag.  (3S will drop down into the 10's much quicker during flight so flight time suffers.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have often thought that running a parallel arrangement might be good as you could split the current load over more cells abusing them less.

So I'm going to dive a bit deeper into the origins of these names and why the distinction between them exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;&lt;em&gt;BEC&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, which stands for &lt;strong&gt;Battery Elimination Circuit&lt;/strong&gt;, has its roots in gas planes. Since their main thrust source was non-electric, they had a separate (usually NiMH) battery to power the receiver and servos, which since those days traditionally take around 4.8 to 6 volts. So when people started putting electric motors on aircraft for thrust, the arrangement stayed the same for a while: A separate big (and high-voltage) battery for powering the main motor, and a small, 5 volts-ish battery for powering the control electronics, which could not take the higher voltage of the main battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, a BEC was a voltage regulator that would &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; that second battery by providing regulated power for the receiver and servos directly from the main battery. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simplest BEC is a &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; regulator (sometimes called &lt;em&gt;LBEC&lt;/em&gt;), a device that drops the voltage of its output by dropping the rest of the voltage on a variable resistor that would dissipate the power flowing through it. The problem with that is that since it works by dissipating the extra power, it's very inefficient when the voltage difference is high: If you've got a 12V main battery and a 5V output consuming 1A of current, the linear BEC must consume the other 7V and 1A of current and lose that to heat. If you've got a 16V battery, that's 11V*1A: more than twice the useful power is just lost to heat! And while you might not care about the loss itself (the main motor is probably eating a whole lot more than that anyway), the fact that the thing heats up like crazy might be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if your control electronics and servos are sufficiently power-hungry, you need a &lt;strong&gt;switching&lt;/strong&gt; voltage regulator or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;BEC&lt;/em&gt;. Switching regulators convert voltages with hardly any power loss, and so can give out lots of amps without heating up too much. An inherent drawback of these regulators is a slightly oscillating output voltage (the technical term for that is &lt;em&gt;ripple&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RAn8l.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RAn8l.png&quot; alt=&quot;A particularly bad example&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different switchers smooth it out to varying degrees (one of the best ways is to stick a separate linear regulator after the switching one), but it's usually still there even after smoothing.&#xA;Anyway, basic plane electronics (i.e. receiver and servos) usually don't care whether there is any ripple or not, as long as it's not too big, so it was the best option for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way came the idea of integrating this regulator &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the ESC, since it gets battery power anyway, and in planes plugs into the receiver with a 3-pin servo header, thus being able to provide regulated power through that header. Thus, for an RC plane, having the BEC built into your ESC means eliminating a whole additional regulator board and not having to wire anything to power your receiver and servos: you only need to plug in the ESC, and voila, all your electronics have power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For multicopters and multi-motor planes, this can get weird, as you have multiple ESCs, and each wants to provide its own power. And having multiple switching regulators try to output to the same place can lead to... &lt;em&gt;unexpected&lt;/em&gt; results. Possibly (though unlikely) even explosive, so flight controllers usually have their own BECs and usually don't have pins/pads for power on their motor connections, while bigger planes tend to use a standalone BEC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now come the marketing terms. a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;BEC&lt;/em&gt; is a &quot;&lt;em&gt;Universal&lt;/em&gt;&quot; or sometimes even &quot;&lt;em&gt;Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&quot; BEC. These are just (hopefully) high-quality standalone voltage regulators that can feature bigger available currents, higher efficiency, better output ripple smoothing (sometimes via a linear regulator), selectable voltages (5V or 12V, sometimes also 6 and 9V, or even the whole range), better reliability, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OPTO is the weirdest of the bunch. Technically, it stands for &quot;optocoupler&quot;, which is a way of electrically isolating your ESC from the other electronics entirely. This can be beneficial when dealing with really high voltages and/or currents, as the voltage ripple generated in the power supply by the motors themselves can be quite high, especially during fast RPM acceleration or braking, and can feed back to your control electronics through either power or ESC control wires. As such, this feature is primarily prominent on the huge, honking 80+ amp airplane ESCs with radiators. However, some quadcopter ESCs are also known to have optocoupling. Since the point of Opto is to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have your FC electrically connected to the ESC, it is almost entirely mutually exclusive with having an inbuilt BEC in the ESC. However on the market that's not always the case, and the term is routinely confused with other things even by the manufacturers, so if you see this marking on an ESC it might be something else. Some models of ESC even use the word OPTO to indicate that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an onboard BEC!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/105811/96108&quot;&gt;an excellent answer on Electronics.SE on why switching regulators are efficient and linear regs are not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T04:16:42.000" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T04:16:42.000" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

On the other hand, I may be overthinking the significance of this aspect and it might be fine either way; the best way to learn that would be to see how others do it; if they only mount the resistor high-side (or only do it low-side), then it must be significant, if they don't care I shouldn't care either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-17T16:26:58.923" LastActivityDate="2020-05-02T10:42:41.550" Title="What are the usual engineering considerations for a UAV current sensor?"

This is why LiPos need to be warmed up before flying in cold weather, as otherwise they will be able to sustain a much lower discharge current than usual and will not give their full rated capacity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONhGJ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ONhGJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lithium Battery capacity vs. temperature&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In flight the current flowing through the pack itself will hopefully generate enough heat internally to keep it warm, though for longer-flying platforms with low current draw (i.e. long-range fixed wing) an onboard heater or thermal insulation may be required to keep the cells warm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for damage, it &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; occur &lt;strong&gt;in storage&lt;/strong&gt; or while discharging even when a LiPo battery is brought below freezing; the rated temperature range for discharging is -20° to +60°C, and the electrolyte itself does not freeze until around -40°. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, storing lithium batteries at 0°C &lt;a href=&quot;https://batteryuniversity.com/index.php/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;prolongs&lt;/a&gt; their life compared to when you store them at higher temperatures. Some owners of Li-Ion batteries even claim to &quot;revive&quot; dead cells by placing them in a freezer for a week or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The one thing you should be really careful about when storing batteries at low temperatures is the possibility of moisture condensation on the battery's terminals when you bring the cold battery into a warm room afterwards or simply if the weather changes. This can cause a short circuit, which, while unlikely to damage the battery (as the water will likely evaporate from the current before anything truly bad happens), it is still unsafe and will corrode the battery's contacts through electrolysis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you decide to store your batteries in the cold, and especially outside, put them in a sealed bag together with a baggy of desiccant (e.g. silica gel) so that the air around the battery is always as dry as possible, and when bringing them inside, do not remove them from the bag until they've warmed up to the ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if you try &lt;strong&gt;charging&lt;/strong&gt; a lithium battery at a below-zero temperature, the battery &lt;em&gt;will be rapidly and permanently damaged&lt;/em&gt; via the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://relionbattery.com/blog/lithium-battery-cold-weather&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;lithium plating&lt;/a&gt; process that damages cells whose voltage is brought too low. The rate of damage is proportional to the charging current (i.e. more current damages your batteries faster), and the extent of it is such that manufacturers state that the battery is completely dead and should be disposed of if it's charged below zero even once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The allowable charging temperature for lithium batteries is 0-45°C, but I'd recommend sticking to the middle of the range and only charging at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the exact numbers (i.e. rated temperatures) are for Li-Ion cells, but they should be close for the whole lithium rechargeable family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-18T14:11:13.073" LastActivityDate="2020-04-18T14:11:13.073" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Particularly so during operation, but your question focuses on storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a real-world example, below are the thermal specifications for DJI's TB50 battery &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dji.com/uk/inspire-2/info#specs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Charging Temperature: 5° to 40° C&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Operating Temperature: -20° to 40° C&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Storage Temperature: Less than 3 months: -20° to 45° C&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Storage Temperature: More than 3 months: 22° to 28° C  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, for shorter term storage much wider temperature variations are considered acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even during storage, there are chemical reactions happening inside your battery. This can be reduced in a couple of ways - storing at the recommended charge level, and at cooler temperatures. The cooler temperatures slow down the reaction rate and can increase lifespan, but depending on the electrolyte the battery can freeze at temperatures as high as -30°C and when this happens, the cell becomes more fragile and the freeze-thaw process can cause damage in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other freezing risk is from moisture or condensation in the battery pack. If cooled quickly, or stored in a cold and humid environment, any water in the pack will freeze and can damage the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before charging, the battery should be thoroughly warmed to within the recommended charging temperature range. Take care to ensure the whole battery has warmed up - for larger battery packs, the core will take longer to warm while the outside feels OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastActivityDate="2020-04-17T08:40:04.307" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Does it matter?  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There should be no significant difference to the measurement if the shunt resistor is on the high or low side. As the resistor is in series the absolute voltage across, and current through, the resistor remains the same. However, there may be a small advantage to one or the other depending your sensor design - for example, having it on the low side makes the measurement relative to the circuit GND, which may reduce the component count of your amplifier/signal conditioning design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What class of amplifier, in terms of precision, is used for the sensed voltage?  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will depend slightly on your design, and you may find the precision of the ADC to be the limiting factor (e.g. an 8 bit 5V ADC has a resolution of 19.5mV.) That said, the job of the amplifier is to match the range of values from your sensor to the input range of your ADC. While a linear relationship is intuitive and straightforward, it may be more desirable to have a curve to give greater sensitivity around the expected ranges but still report invalid values with slightly reduced precision. You would need to characterise the curve and program it into your flight controller for correct reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What range of output voltages does the FC expect?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will depend entirely on the flight controller - but typical ranges for ADCs are 0 to 3.3V or 0 to 5V. Remember that if you want to report a negative reading, you will need to bias your zero value sensor ourput for mid range on the ADC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there any smoothing (lowpass filtering) applied to the sensor's output to reduce aliasing from possible high frequency current ripple?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Filtering is a good idea to help reduce unwanted values. The response time of the filter needs to be fast enough to capture valid changes while rejecting noise. You can compare the filter response rate to your sample rate - your filter response can be slower if you are checking the voltage every 0.5 seconds instead of every 0.05. Alternatively you may decide to do some filtering in software, sampling several times and averaging, but this takes CPU time away from other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastActivityDate="2020-04-17T09:13:05.787" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Almost all of the considerations below stem from the maxim that &lt;strong&gt;the best drone for you is one that you will fly the most&lt;/strong&gt;. Both progression and enjoyment in this hobby (and many other hobbies as well) are directly linked to how much time you spend doing it. Whenever you're unsure about a decision, besides other considerations ask yourself which option will keep you in the air more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, to the list itself. Your &quot;second&quot; drone must be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indestructible&lt;/strong&gt;. Durability is valuable for all quadcopters intended for acrobatic or racing flying, and you'll likely never stop bashing your drone into stuff no matter how high your skill, but unlike the pro pilots who probably break more drones a month than you will ever own, you don't have spares lying all over the place for when you do. For a long time, this is likely going to be the only &quot;real&quot; drone you'll own, so it better be durable. There are two main ways you can achieve that: &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &quot;classic&quot; approach is to have massive unbreakable arms, a titanium cage around the components, etc. That's pretty self-explanatory, though you'll have to pay for it in added weight (which is not that bad if you don't carry a gopro).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other way is for the drone to be so light that it simply doesn't&#xA;have enough inertia to break anything, including itself or even its&#xA;own props. This is the idea behind the &quot;toothpick&quot; class of&#xA;quadcopters, which some consider an excellent choice for&#xA;beginner-intermediate pilots, in part for this reason.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic, but high-quality&lt;/strong&gt;. What I mean by that is that you don't need the fanciest F-infinity processors, top-end performance motors, the lowest-latency camera, etc. What you do need, however, is for all the components to be high-quality and well-built by a reputable manufacturer. i.e. an F4 FC made by a well-regarded manufacturer is better than an F7 FC by a knockoff noname brand. Not only will this reduce your cost (by picking basic components) and add to reliability (by picking trusted brands), it will also make things simpler for you and less heartbreaking when you do break something.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;. However durable your drone, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; crash it, break something and need to fix or replace it eventually. And when it happens, you'll want your drone to be easy to disassemble and reassemble, have replaceable parts, etc. First, this rules out the non-DIY type of drones, but the DIY ones are also not created equal. Some frames make accessing the guts as easy as unscrewing three bolts, while others need more disassembly. A bigger drone is significantly easier to work on, with less tiny fiddly parts, while a small one (3&quot; and smaller), while frustrating to work on at times, will likely break less. For larger (5 inch +) frames, replaceable arms are a very good feature to have, and a simple replace procedure (i.e. unscrewing one bolt versus disassembling the whole frame) is important as well. Toothpicks are an interesting class in that regard, in that they have a tiny whoop-like architecture, with only 4 parts: the frame, motors, camera, and an all-in-one FC+ESC+VTX board which the motors just plug into with pin connectors. This makes them way easier to maintain than other quads of this size, but also less upgradable, since three of the main components are on one board. Which brings us to...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgradable&lt;/strong&gt;. This is closely related to the previous point, but slightly different. You want to be able to swap &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the major parts of the drone (FC, ESC, motors, camera, VTX, frame, etc.) for a different or better model without also having to swap the others or encountering any compatibility issues. This is mainly a jab at some prebuilt quads that have proprietary components in them which would not work well or at all with other off-the-shelf components.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit for your usual flying location&lt;/strong&gt;. This is actually important for any quad, but as this one is likely to be the only one for some time, here it is especially important. The best quadcopter is one that you fly a lot, and so you want yours to be well-suited for the size, configuration, weather conditions and other considerations at the place where you fly the most, as this will maximize your flying time, frequency of flight sessions and enjoyment of the process, all very important contributing factors to how fast you learn and how much you enjoy the hobby. If you buy &quot;the best-flying&quot; copter but it won't fit in your flying field, you won't fly it much at all. The most important parameter here is likely the size class of your copter, which must fit the size of your location. Loosely, it's something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if you mostly fly indoors, you need a tiny whoop (although it's likely you'll later want a separate outdoors quad anyway)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;for a playground/backyard-sized outdoors location with lots of small obstacles (i.e. literally a children's playground) and gaps a larger (75-85) brushless whoop or ~2 inch quadcopter with detachable propguards will offer the most&#xA;enjoyment out of flying in such a tight space while still being able to rip in larger locations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For something like an uncrowded street, large backyard or small park a toothpick-class 2.5 to 3 inch quad would be optimal; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;for larger parks you can go either the toothpick or the 4-5 inch route, depending on how crowded the place is; the former is safer for everyone, less intimidating, and slightly slower, while 4-5 inch quads are noisy, heavy and can do some damage, but are still the undisputed leaders when it comes to flight performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;finally, if you've got huge fields, shorelines or even mountains to fly over, you probably want a 5 or even 6 inch quadcopter that is able to cover the distance well. However don't fly too far without educating yourself on proper long-range operation first, there's a lot of stuff that you need to know (and buy :) in order to not lose your precious quad a couple km away in the first few flights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of the quadcopters that fit all the previous points, choose (or build) &lt;strong&gt;the one that you like the most&lt;/strong&gt; subjectively. Maybe it looks cool, maybe you really like the manufacturer, maybe it's elegant. The factor of likability should not be underestimated. Whatever the reason for you to love the quad, the more you do, the more love, time and effort you'll put into it, making it a better quad and you a better pilot!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final word, I must reiterate. Whichever quad you pick, in the end the most important thing is that you fly a lot. Buy a good amount of batteries, a nice flight backpack, and make a habit out of going out and flying. You'll love every moment of it and of the rest of your life as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorDisplayName="user306" LastEditDate="2020-04-17T19:13:58.537" LastActivityDate="2020-04-17T19:13:58.537" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I’ll try to be concise so if any extra info is required or wanted, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to look at when you’re flying FPV is the kind of aircraft, all the way up from a small Tiny Whoop to an X class (please not for beginners though!). In general, the larger props tend to give more flight time up to a point - it’s generally agreed that 7 inch props should be used for long-range because of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Video Transmitters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to look at on your aircraft (&lt;em&gt;excluding the advantages of different flight controllers etc, which I would love to talk about but would end up writing a massive wall of text&lt;/em&gt;) is the video transmitter, or VTX.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking at these, the first important thing is to check your local laws about what frequencies and transmitter powers you can use. Once you know that, keep in mind that more power tends to equal more range in open spaces, but can lead to more interference in places like abandoned buildings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another important fact to remember about the VTX is that you should manually select the channel on your VTX AND goggles as auto-scan sometimes picks the wrong channel and will cut out after a few feet. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/286/why-is-it-bad-to-power-up-a-drone-without-an-antenna-on-the-vtx/&quot;&gt;never turn on your VTX without an antenna installed&lt;/a&gt;, or you risk damaging it. It is perfectly normal for your VTX to get warm on the bench when there is no airflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will see people talking about Smart Audio - this is just a way to control the settings on the VTX from your transmitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other hardware&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Motors are very important. If possible, get brushless motors as they last longer and are more powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When getting your first FPV quad, check out how repairable it is. It’s almost certain that at some point you will need to repair or modify it, so it’s good to know that before getting the quad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check what voltage your quad is designed to run at. If you have too little voltage, your quad will be underpowered, but if you have too great a voltage your quad may burst into flames (possibly a slight exaggeration to get a point across).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ESC or Electronic Speed Controller is what tells your motor what to do, and you need one for each motor. If possible, get BLHeli_32 ESCs as they are more modern and natively support bidirectional Dshot so you can enable something called ‘RPM filtering).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking at flight controllers, the higher the value of X is in the naming format FX, the better. At the time of writing, F4 is the most common and F7 is becoming more popular. As I said, I won’t go into too much detail, but the higher the number, the more processes the CPU can complete per second so the more filtering and other leaguers you can have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Goggles&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of goggles - box goggles and slimline goggles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, slimline goggles are more expensive, lighter, arguably more comfortable and tend to have a narrower field of view and better quality displays. Box goggles, on the other hand, have massive screens and tend to be cheaper, however they are larger and heavier so may be less comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If possible, get goggles with a diversity receiver (or if you get Fat Sharks of Orqas, get a diversity receiver module like Rapidfire). This has two receivers and can either merge the two signals into one (cleaner) signal, or just automatically pick whichever signal is the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;RC Transmitters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used protocol at the moment is FrSky's D16, with Crossfire becoming more and more popular not only for long-range, but just for general flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When picking your transmitter, look for Hall gimbals, which use the Hall Effect to measure movement instead of potentiometers, so last longer and (apparently- I haven t used them) feel nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of your transmitter will be personal preference, about the ergonomics and whether you pinch, thumb or hybrid-pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Batteries&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For anything more than 1S, you need a balance charger to make sure all the cells have the same voltage. To find the nominal voltage of a battery, multiply the number of cells by 3.7, as the nominal voltage of a single cell is 3.7.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will leave you with this - &lt;strong&gt;don’t leave charging batteries unattended&lt;/strong&gt; - LiPos are very dangerous if mistreated and can burst into flames if damaged or overcharged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditDate="2020-04-21T22:19:02.747" LastActivityDate="2020-04-21T22:19:02.747" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

DO NOT&#xA;power up in the pits or while walking from the pits to the course&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you need to check your video channel or change frequency, this MUST be completed between heats. You&#xA;MUST also ensure you have the appropriate Frequency Card for the frequency you wish to check.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are flying before or after the event you MUST ensure you have the appropriate Frequency Card for the&#xA;frequency you are using.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You MUST ensure you have a Spotter in the Pilot Area while flying. A Spotter observes the course for&#xA;dangers such as members of public, animals, other model fliers, low flying aircraft or vehicles. Spotters&#xA;stand in the Pilot Area to ensure clear communication.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You should help with spotting for the heat before yours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And some more rules we incorporate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If video channels are assigned ahead of time, be sure to show up with all of your drones set to that channel (though changing after arriving is not unusual).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All transmitters (video and remote) should be set to 25mW to prevent someone knocking others out the air.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Never enter the race coarse unless the safety officer gives you permission.

Operations of these aircraft are usually conducted under VMC to ensure the remote pilot can maintain continuous and direct visual observation of the RPA and its surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6.28 RPA that traverse several airspace volumes may operate for the most part under IFR. Such RPA will have to meet the communications, navigation, and surveillance requirements and have an appropriate aircraft operational certification associated with the airspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6.29 &lt;strong&gt;In cases where small RPA have a requirement to fly beyond VLOS, they will need a means to meet navigation capabilities for the airspace within which they are operating. This could involve an alternate means of achieving the navigation performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;LICENSING AND TRAINING FOR PILOTS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE REMOTE CREW&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.8 Remote pilots and other members of the remote crew shall be trained and licensed in accordance with Annex 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.9 Licensing and training requirements will be developed similar to those for manned aviation and will include both the aeronautical knowledge and operational components.

In that context, qualifications for certain categories of remote crew (e.g. VLOS helicopter) may be  significantly different from those pertaining to the traditional qualifications pertaining to manned aviation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;7.10 On the basis of the foregoing, current and previous notional designations for personnel piloting RPA will need to be replaced with applicable terms as contained in Annex 1, appropriately modified to indicate their position being external to the aircraft, such as “remote pilot”, “remote navigator” and/or “remote engineer”, each of which is a member of the remote crew. A new crew position unique to some VLOS operations is “RPA observer”, an individual who, by visual observation of the RPA, assists the remote pilot in the safe conduct of the flight.

In the old days of AM/FM radios, the transmitter is built to transmit on a particular frequency band (e.g. 2.4GHz, or more likely 36MHz in those days).  Then you could add the capability to work with a different frequency band by clipping a module into the back of your transmitter.  As long as your transmitter (or module) and receiver were both AM or FM they'd talk quite happily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When 2.4GHz came along the market became more fragmented, and every manufacturer came out with their own protocols, so you not only had to transmit 2.4GHz, but also speak the right protocol.  This is why different brands of transmitter and receiver (e.g. Frsky/Taranis and Spektrum) can't be mixed interchangeably.  Modules can solve that problem by giving your transmitter the capability to talk different protocols even though they might all be 2.4GHz (e.g. the Jumper Multiprotocol module).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days the two most common use for modules is either support for new protocols (e.g. the multi protocol module on the Jumper radios, or a DSM module on Frsky).  Or different bands, e.g. CrossFire which operates it's own protocol on the 900MHz band (for longer range).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Frsky Taranis is probably the most popular radio today amongst quad pilots.  When Frsky first made their radio they either bought the molds or licensed the design (can't remember which, but it was a legit &quot;money changed hands&quot; transaction, not a rip off clone job) for their case from JR. Once you know this, it's not at all surprising that a Frsky Taranis and a specific model of JR (I'm not sure which) are virtually indistinguishable when you put the side by side. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Frsky radios were made in the same moulds, it would be extremely unlikely for the Frsky module bay and JR bays not to be exactly the same size.  You'll sometimes also hear them called &quot;JR modules&quot;, or &quot;JR module bay&quot; for this reason.  Whether the Frsky and JR modules are electrically compatible I don't know.  i.e. a genuine JR module would fit in a Frsky bay, but I don't know if they'd work and not be damaged.  I assume they would be electrically compatible, but I don't know of anyone who's tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other modern radios (e.g. the Jumper T16) have copied the design of the module bay so that popular modules (such as TBS CrossFire) also work on those radios.  TBS don't sell different Crossfire modules for FrSky and Jumper radios, so these must be compatible with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not aware of any modules that aren't transceivers (either different bands, or different protocols).  Hosting additional transceivers was the intended use of the module bay, I can't think of anything else I might want to install in the back of my transmitter that isn't a transceiver.  Depending on what the pins do, and the voltage and current a module can draw from the radio, in theory there's no reason another device could draw power from the radio via the module pay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="342" LastEditorUserId="342" LastEditDate="2020-04-18T06:32:16.323" LastActivityDate="2020-04-18T06:32:16.323" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The course is laid out in cones, the flags are asymmetrical so you know on which side you should pass, the gates you must fly twice through usually have something (bright fabric, a flag, ...) next to them on the side that you fly around before going back into the gate, etc. and the cones themselves are not just a flat string but are laid out in certain patterns; for example, when the sequence of cones terminates in an arrow this usually indicates you should go upwards (or higher, i.e. in the case of two gates stacked on top of each other), while a perpendicular line marks the entry point of the cone string.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the track elements are colored differently (and asymmetrically) to indicate the direction. Some elements just have canonical uses based on their shape: you should pass through gates, fly besides flags, dive the dive gates... The Jacob's ladder specifically is almost always passed top to bottom in sequence (while whether you should go right or left varies track to track).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there is no universally accepted, set-in-stone standard for these cues. Which ones are used depends a lot on the materials available to the race organizers, how much time they have to set up the track, the track's layout, etc. For instance, flags can either be fabric on a springy pole (in which case you fly on the convex side), or they can be inflatable and curved to hang over the ground (in which case you fly under the overhang on the concave side).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most drone racing leagues have their own standard of how different track elements and maneuvers should be marked on the racetrack and try to stick to it. Even then some smaller local or regional events of the league may be limited by the organizers not having all the required materials. Also, one cannot mark &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; on the more complicated, technical tracks, or mark it in an unambiguous manner. Sometimes some parts of the track are formed by the terrain itself, i.e. an abandoned building or natural rock formation. In that case there's no standard and the track designers must get creative to even make it clear where the gates are!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So visual cues aren't everything. A lot of races rely on communicating to pilots how the track should be flown &lt;em&gt;before the race&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes it's a verbal briefing, sometimes a printed schematic. Sometimes the track is published well in advance so pilots could train on their home field or in a simulator. There could even be a video walkthrough or a DVR of a practice run. Additionally, many leagues actually perform a physical walk through of the track on or before race day (much like Formula 1 car racing), so that the marshals and pilots can discuss challenges, specific items and hazards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, for serious racing, how the track itself is marked does not matter. During the actual race the speed at which everything is happening does not leave you any time to think or figure out what's coming next by parsing the track. The racer just &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; in advance which gate or maneuver comes after the one he's flying through, and anticipates it, most likely along with the one after that as well. &lt;em&gt;Knowing the track&lt;/em&gt; is a very important factor in winning a race, as in order to have the fastest (which usually means &lt;em&gt;shortest&lt;/em&gt;) trajectory, the pilot must start the necessary maneuvers for passing the next gate &lt;em&gt;while he has not yet passed the previous one&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides training beforehand and learning the track from the given materials, the racers are always allowed to fly some laps around the actual final track before the race in order to memorize its layout. This is critical as the actual racetrack will always slightly differ from whatever training track they might have constructed for themselves. During these training laps they also figure out the best way to tackle the elements of that particular track in the speediest way possible, and thus develop an optimal trajectory, or &lt;em&gt;racing line&lt;/em&gt;, as it's usually called. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, &lt;strong&gt;the on-track markings are there just to aid in the initial few laps as the track is being learned by the pilot, and after that, memory takes over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-20T13:57:39.933" LastActivityDate="2020-04-20T13:57:39.933" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is proportional to the instantaneous derivative, or 'rate of change' of stick movement. The faster the sticks are moving, the more FeedForward we get.

Unlike P, FeedForward cannot cause oscillation, no matter how much FF is added.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With FeedForward, we get better stick responsiveness without pushing P so high as to cause wobbles.

Since it's a sum, you can think of them as each pushing the quad in a certain direction independently, some terms adding up and others counteracting each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The P term is the difference between the setpoint and actual rate, multiplied by the P &lt;em&gt;gain&lt;/em&gt;. So the amount of force applied by the P term is directly proportional to that difference. You can think of it as a spring that tries to move the quad back whenever it's bumped out of position. The further it's moved (bigger difference between setpoint and actual rate) and the stiffer the spring (bigger P gain), the stronger it will pull.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why the FF term is needed is because the signal that the PID controller outputs influences the &lt;strong&gt;acceleration&lt;/strong&gt;, not the speed directly. This means that the quad will not get up to speed immediately, but take some time depending on how hard it pushes itself. So when you want to sharply begin a maneuver you want the quad to apply &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of force in that direction to get going and then sustain the rotation with a smaller force. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The PID controller, however, is meant for stabilizing. It does not distinguish between you bumping the stick and the quad being bumped out of position by an obstacle or gust of wind. So when you move the stick it &quot;stabilizes&quot; itself at the new speed as if you didn't move the stick at all and it was bumped by something instead. You can think of moving the stick as moving the other end of the spring that the quad is attached to. The spring doesn't care which end was moved, just that its length changed.&#xA;This means that the PID controller won't apply as much force to start the rotation as it potentially could, which means it is somewhat slow to speed up when you move the stick, and, more importantly, slower to slow down when you move the stick back to center (and can even overshoot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make the reaction faster by increasing the P gain, but to a point, as higher P gains lead to oscillations, when the quad's movements lead to big P terms which in turn cause bigger movements and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So instead the FF term was added. The FF term does not consider the current rotation rate at all, so it does not contribute to the PID loop's stabilizing action and is thus unable to cause oscillations. The only thing that it looks at is the sticks. The force applied by the FF term is proportional to &lt;em&gt;the rate at which you move your stick&lt;/em&gt; (multiplied by the FF gain). &#xA;So when you, for example, initiate a roll and bump the stick to the right, the FF term will detect the fast stick movement and give a burst of force to get the quad going. Then, when you finish the roll and return your stick back to center, the FF term will detect the opposite fast stick movement and apply a corresponding force, helping the PID controller stop the quad's rotation faster and avoid overshooting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-18T13:15:57.480" LastActivityDate="2020-04-18T13:15:57.480" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

So popular flight controllers let you add in some amount of feedforward to have faster response to inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feedforward works very well in appropriate quantities. In a system like a drone, where it's constantly moving around and there is no real long-term, steady-state stability, feedforward can really accelerate response time and enhance accuracy. The devil's in the details, though, as each combination of airframe, motors, propellers, and atmospheric conditions will have a different optimal feedforward. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, there are a myriad of ways to implement feedforward, and so there's no generic advice for how to tune it right.

In the world of &lt;em&gt;classical controls&lt;/em&gt;[*], the PID was king.

Pilots who are used to video game controllers might like a FrSky X-Lite or TBS Tango 2 while others may prefer the FrSky Taranis Q X7. While FrSky radios are the most popular, there are also other great options like the Jumper T16, or controllers made by Futaba and Spektrum. Or if you are interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dji.com/fpv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DJI HD Digital FPV System&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to use the DJI radio since it integrates well with the other DJI components. Once you have a radio, connect it to your computer and practice flying in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://oscarliang.com/free-quadcopter-simulator-drone-multirotor-trainer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;FPV flight simulator&lt;/a&gt;. If you opt for the QX7, be aware that many new pilots assume it comes with a battery or a way to use AA batteries however it does not. You will need to purchase a separate battery for either of these FrSky radios. If you opt for the DJI radio, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPpzOMAq82I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;connect that to a flight simulator&lt;/a&gt; as well using a USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Find Pilots Near You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Search Facebook, YouTube, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multigp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MultiGP&lt;/a&gt; to find other pilots in your area. Sometimes having someone local is the best resource for getting help when you need it. They can also point out safe spots to fly and might be willing to meet up for group events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Education &amp;amp; Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While you are training yourself playing around in the sims, watch every video you can by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/joshuabardwell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Joshua Bardwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/uavfutures&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;UAVFutures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Y2yyiC4P5S_3RnxttT3FqMH8-bRH-4p&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mr. Steel's How To FPV Playlist&lt;/a&gt;, and others on YouTube.

Lots of good info in there. Also knowing how to solder is very important when building or repairing your drone. Get a good soldering iron, watch some tutorials, and practice before the iron ever touches your drone.

Li-ion generally has a larger capacity for the same weight but can provide a lower current. This means that if you are doing slow or cinematic flying, it is worth looking at lithium ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Capacity also has a lot to do with it. Generally, greater capacity provides greater flight time, however this only works up to a point. If I use a 300mAh 2S LiPo on my toothpick, it will provide less flight time than a 450mAh 2S LiPo. However, an 800mAh would probably not give that great a flight time as the added mass takes more energy to lift than the battery can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the cell count has an impact. One of the reasons that people like to fly 6S is that it reduces battery sag, and this means that you can fly for longer before your voltage drops too low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Propellers and motors&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, larger propellers and low KV motors are more efficient. This is why long range builds commonly use 7inch props.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, lower pitch props produce less power but are also more efficient so will increase flight time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flying 2 blade props is also generally more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;All up weight&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a heavier quad will take more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mathematically this is because F=MA, and more energy is required to create a greater force for the same acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Flying style and conditions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flying in windy conditions will often drain batteries more quickly as you have to spin up the motors to fight against the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Batteries also perform worse in cold conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you fly more acrobatically or race, you will drain your battery more quickly than if you are just cruising around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Software settings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, changing settings in your software can improve flight time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, setting your ESCs to 48KHz on tiny whoops and toothpicks can greatly increase flight time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps, feel free to ask for any clarification or if you feel I’ve missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:30.297" LastActivityDate="2020-04-18T15:36:22.110" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The biggest one is to reduce weight.  The less the drone weighs compared to the energy source ( battery etc. ).  The longer it can fly.  You can add larger batteries to increase flight time, but there are diminishing returns there.

Again, though it's going to be a balance between the weight of your battery... go for lighter technologies like LiPo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure you've got new batteries on your drone; as your batteries age, they'll lose juice and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Of course, you won't be able to go as far, so that may not be a tradeoff you want to make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;4. Weather&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you're flying your drone in dry weather... Condensation or water droplets will both add resistance to any moving parts and weight.

To know which camera you should get, make sure you check what format your goggles can use. Most modern cameras can be switched between NTSC and PAL, so&#xA;this isn’t too much of a big deal, but make sure you can check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Size&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you pick a camera that is an appropriate size for your drone.&#xA;The size classes commonly used today, defined by the camera enclosure's width, are Mini (22mm), Micro (19mm) and Nano (14mm). (The &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; size was 28mm).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adapter brackets are available for mounting smaller cameras in frames with larger camera mounts, but there's nothing that would help you to fit a camera that's too wide for your frame.&#xA;For example, a CADDX Ratel which is 19x19mm would not be appropriate for a standard Tiny Whoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Aspect Ratio&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most modern FPV cameras will also have switchable 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios. Check which your goggles is designed for and which you personally prefer, though if you get a switchable one this likely isn’t a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Lens&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lens on your camera will affect the field of view. In general, a shorter lens will give a wider field of view (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oscarliang.com/fpv-camera-lens/#diameter&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). According to the same article, a wider lens can give better image quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Weight&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going for an ultra-light build, every gram counts, and some cameras will be lighter than others. If this matters to you, be sure to check out the camera’s weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Software and other intangibles&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is more to a camera's performance than just the optics. The software that the camera uses to &amp;quot;prettify&amp;quot; the image is no less important, and can make or break the flying experience. Camera manufacturers each have their own WDR, sharpening, denoise, auto-exposure and other algorithms in their cameras, that all affect the picture. There are also some manufacturer-specific bugs in this software, which you may or may not care about. All of that can only be felt by looking at the actual imagery, which brings us to...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Personal Preference&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the most important section.

If you connect packs with differing numbers of cells, the higher cell count pack will immediately overcharge the smaller pack, and there will be fire, flames, choking smoke, alarms, and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming the cell count is the same when you hook up packs in parallel, you basically have an equilibrium reaction happening. Energy will flow from the packs with higher voltage into the packs with lower voltage until they equal out and each pack has the same voltage. The greater the difference in voltages, the more energy transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, people say you should only parallel charge packs with a similar state of charge, ie, it's bad to connect a fully charged pack up with a discharged one. Doing this won't actually end the universe though, it'll just mean the charged pack discharges into the flat-pack - very rapidly. Normally this just means you're charging the flat-pack at a rate far above the recommended rate, which will affect its life in the long term. In extreme cases, it can mean thermal runaway in the flat pack and a fire can result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you plug in a single charged 1300 with 7 other flat 1300s, they'll just get slightly charged up. It's still not good practice to do this of course, but it's just worth mentioning to illustrate the point that being super careful about differing pack voltages isn't the most important thing you need to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Far more important is the &lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt; of the packs, and their various internal resistances and relative capacities. It is not a good idea to parallel charge old packs with new ones. Similarly, be very careful about parallel charging any packs which have been crashed and may be freshly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On to the practicalities. Two types of parallel charge boards are commonly available, those with and without polyfuses on the balance connectors. If you make a mistake plugging in the balance leads, an unfused board will short and you'll burn the tracks off the board instantly (best case), so the use of the safer, fused boards is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fused boards do have one dangerous gotcha though - if you trip the fuses by accident, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; wait for the fuses to reset before charging, or you risk unbalanced packs and fire. It's also possible to partially trip the fuses if you plug the balance leads in first, and too much current flows. So &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; connect the main pack leads first, wait for the voltages to stabilize (with similarly discharged packs 30 seconds is plenty) and only then should you connect the balance leads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To determine the charge rate, simply sum up the capacities of all packs connected, ie for 3 x 1300s and an 1800 = 5700 = 5.7A for a 1C charge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and you should know this already, never ever charge unattended. Fires can and have happened. All it takes is a faulty or damaged cell, a bad balance connector... A smoke detector over your charge station doesn't go astray!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that packs should not get warm while charging, if they do, or if one cell seems warm, discontinue the charge and quarantine that pack immediately until you find out what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds scary, it's not. You just need to be aware of what you're doing and follow the rules.

However, it is not the end of the world if you don’t have as many UARTs as you want as you can use softserial to add software UARTs to your FC. Of course, this also takes up processing power so an F7 may cope better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, F7 flight controllers have built in inverters on their UART ports, while F4's do not.

It's even hard to tell which is better, they're all just &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. So, without further ado, the list:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extruded polymer foam.&lt;/strong&gt; This is what most commercially manufactured models are made of. The manufacturing process involves CNC-machined molds, special extruding machinery, and a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of money spent upfront. However, the models can be of any shape imaginable, are quite durable, light (although not the lightest) have excellent aerodynamics, and the unit cost is cheap once you get going. The load-bearing parts are usually reinforced/stiffened with carbon fiber inserts, although wooden reinforcements are not uncommon. There are several types of foam that can be used, each with different characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hotwired polymer foam.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the DIY method of making foam planes, although some commercially-available planes use it as well. It involves a resistive wire which is heated by a current and is used to cut a block of foam into the desired shape using a &lt;em&gt;bow&lt;/em&gt; or other device that keeps the wire under tension. As with extruded foam planes, load-bearing sections are usually reinforced with carbon fiber for stiffness. The same types of foam can be used as with extrusion. The available shapes are limited by what can be achieved with straight cuts, although complex shapes can be created by gluing simpler sections together. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi3CAtpvJJs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of the process. Sometimes (most of the time?) only the wing airfoil is wire-cut, while the rest of the airplane is fabricated using other methods. Planes made using this method are often covered with heatshrink film to add stiffness and durability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folded flat materials.&lt;/strong&gt; Airplanes can be made from a variety of sheeted materials by cutting, creasing and folding them into shapes which are then glued together. The materials include (but are not limited to) foamboard (foam between two layers of paper/thin cardboard), depron (flat sheets of foam), corrugated cardboard or even paper. The very simplest models can even be made without folding, just by cutting the required outline out of a flat sheet, while the advanced builds feature smooth curved surfaces. While usually not especially sleek-looking, airplanes made using this method fly surprisingly well and are very durable! Most of this comes from the fact that they are also extremely light for their size, though. In any case, a foamboard (or cardboard, or depron) plane is very easy to build or fix and requires minimal tools (knife, ruler, glue) to do so. This type of construction is extremely popular in the RC community due to the simplicity and cheap price. The most prominent proponent of folded models is &lt;a href=&quot;https://flitetest.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flite Test&lt;/a&gt;, who publish free plans for all of their models. There are also countless plans for folded planes on various RC forums.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wood and film.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the &quot;oldschool&quot; method. It is very similar to the methods used for construction of early full-scale aircraft, and involves building a wooden &quot;skeleton&quot; for the plane out of precisely-cut thin pieces of wood (usually balsa) and covering it with a special heat-shrink film to form the surface of the airfoil. This method takes a lot of time and work, and involves cutting and gluing together hundreds of wooden parts. The method creates light, strong and stiff airframes, which can nonetheless be brittle if hit the wrong way in a crash and time-consuming to fix. While less common nowadays, this construction method remains moderately popular, with a great variety of plans available online.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glass and carbon fiber composites.&lt;/strong&gt; While carbon tubes, strips and sheets are used extensively together with all of the construction methods discussed above to add mechanical strength and stiffness in critical points to a weaker or more flexible material, some airframes are constructed entirely out of composites. This is arguably the most high-tech and definitely the most high-performance (if done properly) construction method of the ones discussed here. It is also the most expensive one, per unit, though it doesn't come anywhere near extruded foam in terms of upfront setup costs and thus is within reach of hobbyists who want to make only a small number of copies of their design. Creating a glass or carbon fiber airframe requires making a mold of the desired shape, carefully laying up the fiber, soaking (or &lt;em&gt;impregnating&lt;/em&gt;) it with resin and curing under pressure, usually with a vacuum pump, to make sure that the absolute minimum of that resin actually stays in the part. Then comes sanding, polishing, and assembly of the parts. Carbon fiber, when properly done, is extremely strong yet light, and is used in high-performance thermal gliders and other planes which must withstand extreme forces while being as light as possible. While strong, such planes are often hard to fix when they do get broken (at least without compromising their original strength or lightness). Glass fiber, though somewhat outdated, is also still a popular choice for larger planes, as it is significantly less expensive and easier to fix. Sometimes DIY molded glass fiber reinforcements can be found on planes constructed from other materials, and usually made by laying the fiber directly on top of the fuselage, eliminating the need for a mold.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastActivityDate="2020-04-19T12:17:28.350" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Instead of relying on voltage as the indicator, I've gone to looking at mAh usage (Current in the OSD).

An current sensor that is not calibrated is as effective as landing based on the amount of time you are in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a 1300mAh LiPo, you can use up to 1040 mAh (80% capacity of the LiPo used, where 1040 is the critical point at which your LiPo will likely start to see damage to some degree).

However, there is a good possibility of various weird things happening due to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with connecting more than one motor to a single ESC stems from how these motors are driven. An electric motor works by using electromagnetic coils to pull permanent magnets and create a force on the rotor. However if you just supply current to the coil and leave it as is, after the nearest magnet gets attracted to the coil, it will just sit there in the nearest position. To create a continuous rotation, you need to stop the current as the magnet passes by and reverse it to now repel it and add more rotational momentum to the system. In brushed motor this switching is done mechanically using contacts (brushes) inside of the motor. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A brushless motor does not have this kind of mechanical switching mechanism, so the switching must be done externally, and this is the brushless ESC's job. To do the switching at the correct moment it must detect when the magnets are passing the coils. To do that it constantly measures the voltages on its three terminals (as a magnet passes by an electromagnetic coil, it creates a voltage in it), and uses that information to switch the currents in the motor in perfect sync with the motor's rotation, speeding up the current pulses as the motor speeds up and slowing them down as it slows down. Sometimes, a special situation called &lt;em&gt;desynchronization&lt;/em&gt;, or, colloquially, &lt;em&gt;desync&lt;/em&gt; can occur if the ESC is incorrect in its assumptions about what the motor is doing or how it's going to react and sends pulses that don't correspond to the motor's actual state. With quadcopters this is most common when the motors are spinning at very low RPM, loaded by a reverse airflow (e.g. falling out of the sky bottom-down) and need to suddenly speed up, all of which mess with the ESC's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you connect two motors, the ESC will still think it's one motor. If they are the same brand and model, with the same propellers, it's possible for them to rotate in sync, in which case they will produce more or less the same induced voltages in their wires and react the same to what's supplied by the ESC. Even then, nothing is &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; matched. One motor will likely be slightly ahead of the other, or otherwise slightly off, which is probably not enough for triggering a desync, but means a more confused ESC and less efficiency overall, as one of the motors (or both) is driven suboptimally. Further, when you mount the motors on an actual airplane, conditions may be even more unequal. Suppose that the plane is flying in a crosswind, or even that it's just in a banked turn, so one wing moves through the air slightly faster than the other. Then the load on the motors is even more unequal, and one of them might get just enough ahead of the other to confuse the ESC into either giving up, or just thinking the wrong thing about this weird combined &quot;motor&quot; to send the wrong signals that might, for example, slow down one of the motors and speed up the other, likely ultimately ending in one of the motors desyncing and stopping entirely. This, in turn, can potentially lead to very unpredictable behavior of the model in flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you connect two &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; motors, the most likely thing is that one (or both) of them won't work. Different motors will both create voltages of different magnitudes when rotated, and react with different speed to currents flowing through their coils, so one of the motors will invariably get far ahead of the other in response to a current pulse, making synchronization of the two near-impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to conclude this long-winded explanation, the answer to your question is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't.

An IMU is a device that combines several inertial sensors that measure the craft's orientation and position in space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 6-axis IMU is a composite sensor, which contains two different types of 3-axis sensors on one chip. Usually it is a 3-axis &lt;em&gt;gyroscope&lt;/em&gt; (which measures the rate of rotation of whatever it's strapped onto) and a 3-axis &lt;em&gt;accelerometer&lt;/em&gt; (which measures its linear acceleration). A 3-axis gyro, on the other hand, is just the gyro and nothing else, as a standalone chip. There are also standalone 3-axis accelerometers¹, but accelerometers are almost never used in flying vehicles alone, without gyroscopes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third type of sensor that an IMU can contain is a &lt;em&gt;magnetometer&lt;/em&gt;, which measures the earth's magnetic field² and can be used to tell which way is north. A magnetometer can either be present as part of a 9-axis IMU, of another sensor (e.g. in a GPS unit) or an entirely standalone unit.&#xA;Do you need the accelerometer and magnetometer? Well, it depends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For &lt;em&gt;rate mode&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;acro mode&lt;/em&gt;, as it's more commonly known), the aircraft only needs to know its rates of rotation along all three axes and matches them to the desired rates set by the pilot via stick positions. &lt;strong&gt;For this, just the gyro is sufficient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, in &lt;em&gt;attitude&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;angle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;autolevel&lt;/em&gt; mode (also sometimes called &lt;em&gt;stabilized&lt;/em&gt; mode), in which the pilot defines the desired attitude(orientation) relative to the horizon, which the drone will match, a gyroscope alone is insufficient. The flight controller will need to know not only how fast it is currently spinning, but also which way &quot;down&quot; is relative to itself. Due to a phenomenon called &lt;em&gt;integration drift&lt;/em&gt;³, the flight controller can't maintain this knowledge precisely enough with just a gyro. It needs an accelerometer on board to correct the gyroscope, so &lt;strong&gt;if you want to use these modes, you need both a gyroscope and an accelerometer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A magnetometer (sometimes referred to as a compass) is required for navigation modes, where besides its attitude relative to the horizon the craft has to also know its heading relative to the geographical north. Note that since navigation modes &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; require GPS, you could forgo the builtin magnetometer in the flight controller, and get a GPS unit with a magnetometer in it instead. Or you can get both, one in the FC and one in the GPS, which will increase the accuracy of the readings. (actually, you can double the other two sensors for the same effect; some flight controllers are manufactured with a twin IMU for that purpose.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;¹:&lt;/strong&gt; There are also single- and dual-axis versions of each type of sensor — which only means you'll need several of those to make up a complete IMU. They are rarely used nowadays, as the integrated versions are usually better in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;²:&lt;/strong&gt; Or any other magnetic field, for that matter, which is why you need to keep it away from magnets and steel structures, otherwise you'll get rubbish. There's usually little metal in the air other than what's on your aircraft, though, so magnetometers tend to work quite well in UAVs unless you've got a magnet-latched canopy and put the FC next to it or something. Minimizing interference is also why magnetometers are usually integrated into GPS units and mounted as far away from the rest of the aircraft as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;³:&lt;/strong&gt; Integration drift is an issue that plagues inertial navigation since the beginning of time, and is present everywhere where you can't measure something directly, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; measure how fast it's changing instead (in other words, you can measure the &lt;em&gt;derivative&lt;/em&gt; of that thing). So you &lt;em&gt;integrate&lt;/em&gt; it (add up the changes over time) to get the original value. However, every measurement comes with an error, and the errors add up as well, so your total error will grow all the time and at some point it will get bigger than the original thing you were measuring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, integration drift is like walking in a forest. When you enter the forest, you (hopefully) have a sense of which way north (or some other reference direction) is. As you walk, you can maintain a sense of direction for some time (&quot;I was walking towards the north, so it was in front of me, now I turned left, north must be to my right now&quot;). However, since you don't know &lt;em&gt;precisely how much degrees you turned&lt;/em&gt;, every turn you make will introduce a small error into your &lt;em&gt;direction estimate&lt;/em&gt;, and those errors will add up over time. A couple hours later your sense of direction will have &lt;em&gt;drifted&lt;/em&gt; far enough from the original that you might be heading in the opposite direction from where you think you're going. Even if you tried to just walk in a straight line all the time you would probably stray off course eventually, because without external reference you have no way of telling whether you've &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; been walking in a straight line (this is known as zero drift).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this is to have an alternative source of direction knowledge (e.g. a compass or the combination of the sun's position and time of day, or some other observable directionality in your environment like a distant mountain) which you check regularly and use that knowledge to correct the error in your &quot;internal&quot; sense of direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quadcopter in angle mode has the same problem: to stay upright it needs to know is where &quot;up&quot; is, and a gyroscope can only measure (as an approximation) how much degrees it's been rotated from its previous orientation; it does not know (or care) what that previous orientation was. And even if the FC &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; know its previous orientation, the estimate might have drifted far off from the original. That's where the accelerometer comes in: its job is to measure the earth's gravity, and therefore the direction of &quot;down&quot;, and use that information to figure out the initial orientation when the quadcopter is armed (like knowing where north is when entering the forest), as well as correcting possible drift of the orientation obtained from the gyros in flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-06-10T15:08:04.237" LastActivityDate="2020-06-10T15:08:04.237" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Unclean signals can result in more inflight oscillations and hot motors. Several different kinds of filters are used, often simultaneously, to accomplish this. (&lt;em&gt;e.g. static &amp;amp; dynamic notch filters, low/high pass filters, Kalman filters&lt;/em&gt;) The below image depicting the suite of filters employed by Betaflight helps get across how serious an issue this is, although it isn't quite accurate today.

The frequency of motor vibrations are directly correlated with their rotation rate, so the Betaflight RPM filter takes input from the ESCs about motor speeds (&lt;em&gt;using bidirectional DSHOT&lt;/em&gt;) and uses it to target a series of dynamic notch filters which selectively remove noise from the gyroscope values occurring at a specific frequency.

That said, it is unlikely that you will cause damage to your motors by putting too high-pitched of a prop on your drone; racers have been known to put ridiculously high-pitch props on ridiculously high-KV motors &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; push them to the limit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your battery &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; sag somewhat in almost any case, though. 2750 is already a high KV for 4s; the consensus is that the &quot;sweet spot&quot;, middle-of-the-road KV for 4s lies in the 2400-2500 range, and 2750 is towards the &quot;ludicrous speed&quot; side. Putting aggressive props on will add even more to that effect, drawing very high current at high throttle, but also providing very high top speed. So I'd probably advise starting from the lower pitch range, 4.0 and less, and increasing it if the drone flies okay and you feel like you want more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question you should be asking yourself, though, is &quot;which prop will feel the best for me on this quad?&quot;. Order a bunch of different-pitch props (preferably from the same manufacturer), put up a current readout on your OSD and fly them all in order to see which ones you like best and which pitches strain your system too much. After that you can try out similar-pitch props from different manufacturers to see if they make any difference (i.e. some propellers may be more efficient than others, reducing current consumption).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the best prop for your drone will depend on a lot of factors besides just the technical specification of your drone, a very big part of which is what you're doing with it (racing, freestyle, long range, fun cruising, etc.), how you do it, e.g. your piloting style, and how you like your drone to feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-19T22:42:30.450" LastActivityDate="2020-04-19T22:42:30.450" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For instance, for a tiny whoop-size quad the gains must typically be raised 3x or more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd imagine this means that for a larger quad the gains should be several times lower than the default, although I have no way of confirming this. In any case, having low PID gains doesn't promote dangerous behavior from the quad, so it's safe to start by cutting the default gains in half or even 3x and working from there. I'd also predict that a bigger quad, having more inertia in both the motors and the frame itself, will need larger feedforward gains to feel responsive than a typical 5&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to try and google some published PIDs for a similar-size quad, although that might be a dangerous proposition if you just copy them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, start from a safe number (it's a 10 inch, so be safe. be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; safe) and &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; work your way up. Analyzing the step response in BlackBox logs to gauge the direction in which you need to tune is probably a good idea as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other place you should look at is the filtering tab, as a larger quad naturally has lower characteristic frequencies. It's great that you run RPM filtering, but take a look at the regular lowpass filters as well, you might want to lower the cutoffs for them. You may want to look at your BlackBox logs here as well to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than the radically-different gain numbers and possibly playing with the filters, though, the configuration shouldn't be all that different.

The short version is that based on evidence gathered from flight recorder logs, the ICM series gyros are more sensitive to electrical and mechanical noise than the MPU6000 gyro.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the major issues is that the MPU6000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cdiweb.com/2017/07/21/tdk-invensense-nrnd-replacement-parts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;is considered NR/ND&lt;/a&gt; (Not recommended for new designs) since 2017-ish, and there is some question as to how much longer it will be available.  This makes manufacturers hesitant about using it in new designs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core of the argument around the ICM gyro has to do with the DLPF bypass mode that enables 32 Khz read rates (&lt;a href=&quot;https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DS-000176-ICM-20602-v1.0.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;see section 9.17 in the datasheet for the ICM 20602&lt;/a&gt;). There is one school of thought that this mode simply gives lower-level access to the same data that is used by the internal DLPF to create the 8 Khz data output, and external software filters can do a better job than the internal DLPF used to create the hardware-given 8 Khz data.  There seems to be a good deal of support however that this is not the case. It appears that moving the gyro into 32 Khz read mode actually reduces the fundamental accuracy of the readings being taken. Mark Spatz has done a good deal of work &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/UAVTech1/posts/2190748527852936&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;logging and analyzing data recordings&lt;/a&gt; from multiple gyros with the conclusion that 32 Khz in experimental mode is producing data that is both different and dramatically less accurate than when not in experimental mode, though why disabling the internal DLPF would have this impact still remains a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even taking this into account, the ICM series gyros can perform essentially as well as the MPU600 when care is taken. Many of the issues seen with the ICM gyros result from poorly executed filtering on the 3.3v power supply. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imeko.org/publications/wc-2012/IMEKO-WC-2012-TC4-P27.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this research article&lt;/a&gt; for an exploration of why this is a problem. Essentially if the power supply lines can be kept clean, and the internal DLPF is kept on, the gyro seems to perform decently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that being said, having been involved in support in the drone industry for a while though, my personal experience has been that flight controllers that use the ICM gyro have a higher failure rate and a higher chance of having issues than flight controllers with the MPU6000. I have a shelf full of flight controllers I pulled due to ICMs that became too sensitive to tune, and much larger number of folks I've helped debug with the same issue, but I've not had that issue with MPU6000.

With DJI, for instance, the picture will suddenly get very blocky and low-res when it gets out of range.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also, digital systems can have inconsistent latency that changes in flight (DJI in particular is known for this), although this mostly concerns the highest-performance pilots, such as racers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The only digital system currently in widespread use is the DJI system, which is a proprietary standard with only two manufacturers authorized to make the gear.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analog and digital systems have about the same usable range per unit of VTX power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To compare how they look, it's better to just see the videos:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2DL5AKccxI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DJI HD system range &amp;amp; breakup vs analog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE02v3fx5m4&amp;amp;t=972s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ByteFrost image &amp;amp; breakup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How they work and the reasons for noise/breakup related differences:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything that is encoded in a radio signal at a point in time can be represented as a &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt;, which can be higher or lower; Thus the &quot;primary&quot; information encoded in the signal can be represented as a graph of this level over time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WbgTV.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WbgTV.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph of an analog signal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an analog system that level can take &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; value, within some range, which we'll think of as 0 to 100% for simplicity(*). It can be 20%, 70% or 48.573498%, theoretically to any degree of accuracy. The drawback to that is that any noise that's floating around in the radio spectrum will &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; to whatever signal you're receiving, so in practice, you'll get something like 40% (true signal) + 5% (noise) = 45% (received signal), and since the original signal could be anything, the receiver has no way of knowing which part of what it got is noise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The image that your goggles receive is made up of pixels, and the color that each of them has is encoded as percentages of red, green and blue: zero to 100%. An analog TV system encodes this picture by &quot;scanning&quot; over all of the pixels in sequence, line by line, and setting the signal's level equal to each pixel's brightness in turn. For example, this oscilloscope picture represents the TV signal for the &quot;colored bars&quot; picture:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLpH2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLpH2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Color bars TV signal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ATSBM.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ATSBM.png&quot; alt=&quot;The colorbars picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ladder you see represents how the brightness level of the pixels changes from left to right in each line of the image.&#xA;There are also other signals overlaid on top of it, these correspond to the lines closer to the bottom of the image, which have other sequences of colors in them (the oscilloscope displays all the lines together on one screen).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consequence of all that is that whenever there's another signal on your frequency around, it gets added to your VTX's signal and through that directly to your picture. Since usually that other signal is noise(**), your picture is overlaid with noise.&#xA;When your signal is strong, the noise is a very small percentage of it and is usually unnoticeable by the eye. As the useful signal gets weaker, though, the noise (which stays the same) will get stronger &lt;em&gt;compared to it&lt;/em&gt;, so the percentage of noise in your picture increases. At some point, it will become so strong that you couldn't see any useful signal in the picture anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;digital system&lt;/strong&gt;, however, only two levels are available: 0 and 1, represented by 0% or 100%(***). The image is encoded into a sequence of bits using a special algorithm, called a &lt;em&gt;codec&lt;/em&gt;, and decoded from that sequence on the other end, almost exactly like online video. Besides simply encoding the video feed, one of the most important functions of modern codecs is to &lt;em&gt;compress&lt;/em&gt; it, so that it can be communicated in a significantly smaller amount of bits, which in turn means that higher-resolution video can be transmitted with the same &lt;em&gt;bitrate&lt;/em&gt; (number of bits sent per second).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since radio signals are by their nature analog, on the receiving end noise will still be added to the signal, so if a 0 was transmitted and 10% of noise is added by the environment, the received result is 10% — but since the receiver &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; that only either 0 or 100% could have been transmitted, it picks the closest possible level, in this case, 0.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that when you transmit digital data, noise is just &lt;em&gt;ignored&lt;/em&gt; until a certain point: Even when noise levels are as high as half of the analog signal (which creates a picture that's rather hard to parse), with digital you receive exactly the same information as you would if there were no noise, with the resulting video perfectly clear. However, when the relative noise level &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; pass the critical threshold, ones will start suddenly (and randomly) becoming zeroes and vice-versa. What happens to the video after that depends on the particular digital system and how the video is encoded in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the DJI system, the whole screen suddenly becomes low-res and blocky, occasionally skipping frames, and the latency increases. The cumulative effect of this can range from &quot;just an unpleasant-looking image&quot; to &quot;totally unflyable&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIbUE.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/rIbUE.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DJI breakup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Fatshark's Bytefrost system (currently in development/beta testing), random bits of the image will flash with colored blocks, while the rest remains high-resolution. The manufacturer touts this &quot;analog-like&quot; style of image breakup as a feature of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FbuLM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/FbuLM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bytefrost breakup&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, digital breakup, when it does happen, is arguably harder to see through than analog breakup, because our brain still has better error correction software than seen in these systems. This is also due to the fact that digital images, while crystal clear up to a point, start breaking up sharply after that point and quickly get to &quot;very hard to parse&quot; levels, while an analog picture is already quite static-ridden by then and just continues to gradually get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, digital systems can employ error-correcting codes and other tricks to be able to recover from a certain percentage of errors, at the expense of reduced &lt;em&gt;bitrates&lt;/em&gt;, yielding a lower-quality image which can be decoded from a longer distance.  you'll typically see them start to gradually reduce image quality before breaking down completely, giving you some warning signs that you are going out of range. There is also usually a link health indicator somewhere in the corner that is similar to the RSSI reading for RC control systems which you could look at to see if you're going out of range. You probably aren't going to be looking at it all the time, though, and a low signal indication can be missed, while it's hard to miss an image full of static and getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(*): The analog signal can technically be any real number, and can sometimes go beyond its designated range, i.e. in our example be less than 0 or bigger than 100%. How the system handles the signal going out of its designated boundaries is the system's business.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(**): the other common kind of interfering signal is &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; signal that's reflected off of something. In which case you will get two of the same picture overlaid on top of each other, but one of them which is slightly late and is shifted to the right because of that. This is called &lt;em&gt;multipath interference&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;multipathing&lt;/em&gt;, and is a major source of image degradation with analog FPV systems. Cutting down on multipath signals &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/120/what-is-circular-polarization-in-antennas/282#282&quot;&gt;is also the primary reason why circular-polarized antennae are used in FPV.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(***): Actually, a digital system can have more than two values, and there are different ways of representing them as analog levels; the main distinguishing factor is that there's a fixed (integer) number of them. For example, for a simple digital system with 4 levels, they would be 0, 33%, 66%, and 100%, with corresponding ranges of -∞ to 16%, 16-50%, 50-83%, and 83%-∞.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-20T21:24:50.427" LastActivityDate="2020-04-20T21:24:50.427" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Different ESC's have different ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many ESCs would perform best under 85°C and some microcontrollers work better if under 70°C. But there are ESCs that can work just fine with hotter temperatures. For example, Castle Creations ESCs can handle a sustained 70-82°C and will have issues around 100°C but most ESCs will have lower tolerance levels and may have issues above 80°C. In general, the closer an ESC is to room temperature, the better it's longevity will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an ESC gets too hot, several things could happen that would result in it burning out.

They can be broken down into three components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Torque lever arm&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Angular Velocity and Acceleration&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moment of Inertia&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Torque Lever Arm&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially the distance on the axis is directly proportional to the torque lever arm. This means that in order to counteract outside influences on the system, the motor has to exert less force to stabilize the system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MbJ8g.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/MbJ8g.gif&quot; alt=&quot;torque equations&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Angular Velocity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also as a result of the increased distance from the center of rotation, a given velocity of the motor produces a lower rate of rotation due to the increased angular distance needed to travel. The motor has a fixed linear velocity for a given RPMs that is defined by the torque production of the motor, the velocity constant, and the pitch of the prop. Effectively this means that the longer the lever arm, the slower the rotation rate for a given linear velocity of the motor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HoRRL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HoRRL.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;angular velocity&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind angular velocity and linear velocity are directly proportional since motor velocity is a constant defined by the motor and prop combination, not impacted by radius. As a result, angular velocity is inversely proportional to radius (w = v / r). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily the case for acceleration however. One might be tempted to think that because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;F&lt;em&gt;r = I&lt;/em&gt;a (Force x radius = moment of inertia x angular acceleration) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that the angular acceleration might also be equal because the r and I components of this equation cancel each other out by definition. The moment of inertia increase cancels out the torque increase due to distance in this equation as written. This results in net neutral equation given that r is changing equally on both sides of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;F * r = m*r^2*a&#xA;m * dv/dt * r = m * r^2 * dw/dt&#xA;m * dv/dt * r = m * r * r * (dv/r)/dt&#xA;m * dv/dt * r = m * r * dv/dt&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplification however, since we're not dealing with a point moment system defined by this equation. The motors make up only a small portion of the total distributed mass and resulting total moment of inertia. Since the distributed distances on the right do not equal the point force distance on the left side of the equation, as the radius at the point of force increases the rate at which the motors achieve the defined angular velocity speeds up. Essentially their effect against the system-wide moment of inertia is greater. This results in an interesting combination of a more stable system due to both lower sustained velocity at equivalent stick deflection and faster initial rates of change.  Because of the very fast rate of change the motors are already capable of producing, the constant angular velocity matters more to control rates for the pilot, while the angular acceleration matters more to the PID controller and resulting stability, so this combination is particularly effective. Going to a longer lever arm on an axis &quot;calms down &quot; that axis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more details check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/6-1-rotation-angle-and-angular-velocity/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this lesson on angular velocity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/10-1-angular-acceleration/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this lesson on angular acceleration&lt;/a&gt; over at Lumen Learning&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One major consideration, particularly in racing and freestyle quads is that the accleration component happens so quickly (in the 100ms range) that it doesn't play a major role in the pilot control of the craft. The acceleration factor primarily impacts tuning and the PID authority. If you look at flight logs of a stretch X quad you'll see the that the stretched axis the motors are running at a higher percentage to achieve the equivalent rotational rate to non-stretched axis (assuming the flight controller rates are set equal on both). If you were to adjust the FC rates so the motor output was equal on both axes, the stretched axis would rotate at a slower rate than the non-stretched axis. The rate systems generally equalize this, but there are still changes in the system that impact the effective resolution on the stretched axis vs the non-stretched. The end result is that the stretched axis feels less jumpy with finer control than the the non-stretched axis. Basically it has greater control authority with more effective steps of motor throttle resolution per degree of rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Moment of Inertia&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moment of inertia also plays a second less obvious role. On most quads, the mass distribution from pitch axis is actually greater than the roll axis. The camera and battery are typically arranged so that their maximum distance from the center of rotation is greater on the pitch axis than the roll axis. This is especially true on freestyle quads with a top mounted battery. This is less true, but still true to a certain extent on race quads with bottom mount batteries. Essentially what this means is that assuming zero outside forces, the pitch axis is already going to react slower to to forces attempting to change the angular velocity than the roll axis, even with an exactly symmetrical frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The combination of these factors brings us to the crux of why frames may choose stretch or wide configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Stretch X&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Race frame prefer the stretch X configuration. This is increasing the effective control on the pitch axis.  Remember because quads don't have vectored thrust (the thrust is always normal to the plane of the motors) They have to tip forward to gain speed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/9AFYEm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/9AFYEm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Effectively this means that very small changes in pitch create large changes in altitude as the vertical component of thrust changes. The larger the forward angle, the larger the horizontal component of thrust, the more altitude is gained/lost per degree of rotation. This makes a more stable and less &quot;twitchy&quot; pitch axis a very attractive proposition for a race quad where fine control of altitude is critical. Also keep in mind roll and yaw are largely inverted when traveling at high speed amd the resulting high forward angles, and having a proportionally higher sustained rotation rate on the roll axis becomes important as well. Tracking in corners will feel more direct, and pitch will feel more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Wide X&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freestyle frames prefer a wider roll axis. Essentially the wider roll axis and resulting increase in effective resolution is compensating for the moment of inertia on the pitch axis, giving finer control on the roll axis and giving a more similar feeling to pitch. You end up with a much more equal type of control on roll and pitch, which is important to freestyle pilots who are more about doing tricks and ballistic maneuvers that rely on symmetrical control on roll and pitch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also it's worth noting that a major reason for the wide X configuration on freestyle quads is keeping the props out of the view of the HD footage. I believe the this was the original reason, and the control gains were merely a happy accident.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="169" LastEditDate="2020-05-05T15:10:55.783" LastActivityDate="2020-05-05T15:10:55.783" CommentCount="3" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The magnets in the E series appear to be a bit thinner than the standard line counterparts, but likely they are a tier lower in rating.

The top part of the bell and bearing race are machined from aluminum. The shafts typically steel or a titanium alloy and are CNC machined in a lathe. The steel flux ring is typically pressed, and the stators are stamped from existing templates for the most part.  The machining is somewhat expensive comparatively, the stamped and pressed parts are relatively inexpensive compared to the other costs involved. In general, it's a fairly complex manufacturing process, and the materials are not necessarily the cheapest. The cost goes down as volume goes up, and a lot of what we use in the DIY drone industry is fairly small batch production, which helps drive up the cost. There's also the supply and demand question and to a certain extent, the cost is set by what the market is willing to pay. That being said I personally know a lot of brushless manufacturers, and the race to the bottom on prices that we're seeing in certain parts of the hobby (low-cost FPV motors) are pushing the absolute limits of the margins. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brushed motors, on the other hand, have essentially no CNC'd parts, almost everything is pressed or stamped including the can. Average quality brushed motors with average tolerances and efficiency are cheap and easy to produce. The cost with brushed motors comes when you need to increase precision, performance, and efficiency.

Ducted fans can provide more lift and are more efficient than open-prop designs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A helicopter would only have one motor and would need to be much larger to provide the same thrust as a quadcopter. Those other configurations mentioned would also not have nearly the thrust of a quadcopter of a similar size. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the best option would be a ducted-fan quadcopter (or hexacopter/octocopter if you can use lots of motors) with oversized motors. A good propeller would be a large prop as it gives more thrust at the expense of maneuverability and acceleration. Wider motors give you more torque but taller motors give you more RPMs so that depends on the prop. (A heavy aggressive prop should go with a wide motor and a lighter prop should be paired with a taller motor)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't really care about longevity, get a powerful ESC, high cell-count battery (probably 6s), and get a motor that is higher than normal KV for maximum thrust and power at the expense of the motor's longevity.

Hall-effect gimbals are far less susceptible to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For multirotor builds using Betaflight, this can be accomplished by reading out the values in the &quot;Receiver&quot; tab of the configurator application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMk5X.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PMk5X.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-27T03:50:19.907" LastActivityDate="2020-04-27T03:50:19.907" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Their screens are also smaller, which means that getting good resolution makes the displays more expensive. There are two screens in this type of goggle, which means that some goggles (for example the Skyzone Sky02X) can support 3D video if you have the required camera and VTX hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Box goggles, on the other hand, are larger and have a larger, single screen. This means that some people find these goggles less comfortable, but this brings the advantage that some goggles can fit a set of glasses inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Screens&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are different types of screens used in goggles. OLED is generally favoured as looking better with deeper colours, but LCD is usually cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Receiver&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many goggles have receivers built-in, and some don’t. There are also different kinds of receivers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When looking for goggles, you really want a ‘diversity’ receiver. This means that the goggles receive two video signals and either pick the strongest or merge the signals to create a stronger one. This means you can add an omni and patch antenna, two patch antennae or two omni antennae.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most goggles will have a receiver built-in, but the more expensive goggles, such as Fatshark HDO2 and Orqa's FPV.one, don’t come with a receiver, which means you need to buy your own. This gives you more choice to pick a receiver that best serves your needs, for example adding a Rapidfire module which is widely regarded as one of the best receiver modules out there at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;IPD and Diopter settings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most slimline goggles will have an adjustable inter-pupillary distance. When picking your goggles, make sure that the IPD is suitable for your face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have glasses, it is also useful to make sure your goggles either have adjustable diopters (for example the Fatshark HDO2) or can take diopter inserts (for example the SkyZone Sky02X).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Battery input&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways that people commonly power their goggles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first of these is a built-in battery that you charge through USB. Counterintuitively, it is usually the cheaper goggles that have a built-in battery, as this means that it is either more difficult to replace the battery, or you can’t bring spare batteries with to fly for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next kind is a Li-ion pack. These generally take 18650 Li-ion cells and are held in the head strap. These usually have larger capacities than the third type of batteries: LiPo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many people use LiPos to power their goggles, either through a specialised battery to hold in the head strap, or with a cable to a battery in the pocket. The latter of these has a distinct advantage: you can use your quad’s batteries (as long as your goggles support the voltage) and you can charge them on your balance charger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Brand&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I usually would say that brand loyalty shouldn’t play too much of a part, but when looking at goggles you want to buy from a brand that you know will offer technical support if you have a problem with your goggles. So I don’t introduce bias, I’m not going to say which brands I prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Features&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DVR is important in goggles, which is helpful to find your quad if it crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another ‘feature’ is a power button. It sounds odd, but many FatShark goggles don’t have a power button. If a power button is important to you. Make sure to look for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another useful feature is a fan (mainly for slimline goggles) as this de-dogs the goggles during a long flying session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Light-leak resistance is very important. If light gets into your goggles, this can break the immersion. Take a look at the reviews online to see what people think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Screen Quality&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, before buying, take a look online to see if you actually like how the screens look. People such as Joshua Bardwell will actually put a GoPro in the goggles so you can see what they look like in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:30.297" LastActivityDate="2020-04-25T10:02:37.037" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This symmetrical change in thrust allows for quicker rotation than would otherwise be possible if the flight controller only increased power on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trouble comes when a pilot tries to change the attitude of the multirotor when the throttle commanded by the pilot is near zero (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;min_throttle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). The flight controller obviously can't decrease the speed of a motor below zero (&lt;em&gt;aka. idle speed&lt;/em&gt;), so it has to do something to ensure it can achieve the cyclic rate the pilot wants. Without anything to fix this behavior, the flight controller would only respond with as much as it could without making any motors increase thrust more than the others can decrease thrust. This results in massively decreased control authority at low throttle because the flight controller can only provide minuscule adjustments to motor thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where idle up and airmode come into play, although they solve the problem a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Idle Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Idle up is setting configurable in the RC transmitter which changes the throttle curve at the low end so that it the bottom-most throttle position doesn't actually correlate to the transmitter sending zero throttle to the multirotor. Instead, it would send some low value that you configure, usually below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would allow the flight controller to speed up and slow down motors by the amount you configure for the increased idle speed, which is a lot better than what it could otherwise accomplish at low throttle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Airmode&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most modern flight controller firmwares support airmode, including Cleanflight and Betaflight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When enabled on the flight controller and the pilot commands a large rotation while at low throttle, the flight controller temporarily pretends that the pilot's throttle command is high enough for it to slow down motors to zero throttle and still achieve the cyclic rotation rate the pilot wants. When the pilot commands less cyclic rotation rate, the flight controller stops pretending that the throttle command is higher than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a graphical explanation of this functionality using graph paper, I recommend taking a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2nRrVENEYM&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Joshua Bardwell's video about airmode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To see what this looks like visually during low-throttle maneuvers, I recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zkTqc2CF3-g?t=334&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Le Drib's video about idle up vs. airmode&lt;/a&gt;.

To be perfectly honest we're well within the rating of even 20A (25A 10 second burst) ESCs in terms of sustained current draw on almost any setup you can imagine. It's not sustained in-flight current that kills stuff. Dynamic unloading means current draw drops pretty quickly as the quad is moving forward even at full throttle, and there aren't too many batteries that can sustain even 100A for more than a few seconds. After 3-4 seconds the battery sags and the current drops away. I've never seen a battery that can sustain 100A for a full 10 seconds, even the highest C rated (for whatever that's worth) packs at high mAh. I've flown some ridiculous setups on even 20A ESCs and drained 1300 mAh from a pack in under 90 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What kills ESCs is transient spikes. As you mentioned typically those spikes come from blocked props or impacts during rotation that stops the motor. Also, those spikes can come from desync situations between the motor and the ESCs which has basically the same impact as a blocked motor, a current dump into the coils due to stall condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I point this out is that a larger torque load on the motors can end up dramatically increasing those current spikes, not on a normal forward flight, but on rapid changes in RPM. If you check out the data on MQTB, you can see the instantaneous spikes on heavier props are dramatically higher than lighter props. Even on fairly light 5&quot; props, current spikes on rapid throttle changes can hit upwards of 150A for a couple of milliseconds during rapid throttle changes. This is under static load, and the spikes can be even higher when the effective angle of attack is even greater (such as rapid changes in direction at full throttle when the quad is moving the opposite direction from thrust.) For instance, I logged on the bench a 2207.5 1800kv motor hitting 170A briefly on 6S during an instantaneous change in the throttle from 11% to 100%. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jeRD.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jeRD.png&quot; alt=&quot;2207.5 transition curves&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that the more torque a motor is capable of producing (the larger the motor stator size, tighter air-gap, or stronger magnets, etc) the larger these current spikes can become. Highly loading a larger, torquier motor is going to create larger spikes, given that torque is directly proportional to the current in brushless motors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, this brings us to the solution. If you're using a BLHeli_S or 32 ESC you can decrease the ramp-up power, which largely eliminates these spikes. If you're considering pushing the torque limits of a motor I highly recommend making this change. Even 5&quot; on 6S, reducing ramp-up power dramatically reduces the risk of desync conditions and smoked ESCs, and you're likely to run into similar.  Even if you don't instantly smoke the ESC, the transient current spikes increase the day-to-day wear on the electronics, so making this change will likely increase the longevity of your gear in such high torque load situations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-23T05:01:28.513" LastActivityDate="2020-04-23T05:01:28.513" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

What you can do is measure the distance from the center of the motor to the closest thing (probably the frame) that would block the propeller. Multiply that by two, and a few millimeters smaller than that is the maximum prop size/diameter. (smaller props can also work)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example: if the center of a motor is 2.6 inches away from a frame, I would get 5'' props.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next thing to look at is the pitch and number of blades. This is where most of the numbers come in for props. Let's use the example of 5143. the first part, 51, is the prop diameter (5.1'') and the second part is the pitch of the prop, 43, which would mean that the pitch of the prop is 4.3''. A higher pitch generally uses more power but can result in faster flying to some extent. (sometimes the prop pitch is not entirely accurate, as it depends on what the manufacturer thinks) The number of blades of the prop will be listed separately when the dimensions of the prop are listed like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way you may see prop dimensions formatted is like this: 5.1x4.3x3. That essentially says the same thing except it also includes the number of blades, which in this case, is 3. The 5.1 is 5.1'' diameter and the 4.3 is 4.3'' of pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I would recommend is to try many different types of propellers because many props that have the same measurements will perform differently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="170" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-22T02:01:54.657" LastActivityDate="2020-04-22T02:01:54.657" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Furthermore, the &lt;code&gt;+/-&lt;/code&gt; signs indicate if a motor is spinning clockwise or counterclockwise.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This mixing matrix is the math that allows us to determine the motor speeds required for the desired movement (roll/pitch/yaw/thrust). Without that, nothing can work-- a quadcopter will fall like a rock without autonomous motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mixing matrix is subtle in that it tells the tale for the aircraft. For yaw, in particular, we're interested in the z-torque relationship on the third row. If there were other combinations of +/- signs, i.e. you didn't have opposite motors spinning the same direction, then the matrix would either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lose a special property called &lt;em&gt;invertibility&lt;/em&gt;. Without that special property, there are NO possible combinations of motor speeds which can give us an arbitrary combination of roll, pitch, yaw, and thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What that means is that everything becomes coupled. You can't make the drone yaw right without also accidentally rolling and/or pitching and/or climbing.

More aggressively (&lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt;) pitched propellers can be said to &quot;grip&quot; the air more than less aggressive pitches because they will go further per rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for high blade count propellers, which will also go further per rotation due to the fact that there's more surface area for air to exert a reaction force against.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I think that the idea that propellers need to trade increased pitch and increased blade count for rotation speed is technically wrong. Just like how saying that &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/q/236/97&quot;&gt;higher kV motors require lower-voltage batteries isn't technically correct but in practice holds true&lt;/a&gt;, I believe the same holds true for propellers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is true that aggressively pitched and higher blade count propellers require more powerful motors to drive because they do more work per rotation. This is the reason why in practice these propellers are usually paired with lower-kV motors which spin slower per volt because they require less rotational velocity to do the same amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that some (&lt;em&gt;well-designed&lt;/em&gt;) propellers mitigate the increased work required to spin propellers with more than three blades by decreasing the chord length of each blade, thus decreasing the area of the blade and the work required to rotate it. This is where reading the spec sheet of the propellers you want to use and taking a careful look at the aerofoil geometry is key. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ovkpi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ovkpi.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(aeronautics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;cit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, nothing would stop you from pairing a high-voltage battery with a high-kV motor and an aggressively pitched propeller with many blades.

Even when the motors are doing less work, they are generating a base level of wasted energy (heat, noise, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased 'dry' weight&lt;/strong&gt; - Not only the extra motors, but more airframe is needed to hold them and more batteries are needed to achieve similar flight times.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased size&lt;/strong&gt; - the aircraft is, in most cases, going to be larger to keep the propellers apart which could affect use cases (e.g. doesn't fit indoors, but can be seen further outdoors.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt; - the need for more parts (or more specialised parts) increases the price of the system.

Freestyle pilots usually make use of near-total stick deflection and extreme rate profiles targeting ~600-1200 deg/s of angular velocity. The fact that the flight controller speeds up motors on the side which needs to rotate &quot;up&quot; and slowing down those on the side which needs to rotate &quot;down&quot; ensures that the move occurs as fast as possible because all four motors contribute to the torque which rotates the multirotor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other factor which helps the multirotor not descend too much is the skillful management of the throttle during the move. By lowering the throttle to near idle while the craft is inverted, the pilot minimizes the amount of thrust the craft generates which acts to pull it down towards the ground.

People in our hobby have tried nearly everything under the sun. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most well-known tradeoff in RF is that between frequency and penetrating power. In general, higher frequency transmissions will not be able to travel as far and penetrate as many obstacles as lower frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would make it sound like lower frequencies would always be better, but this is not the case. Especially in the case of FPV video, available bandwidth and interference issues become more of a concern than pure range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With increased frequency comes higher bandwidth and reduced latency, which is to say that the 5.8 GHz band accessible to us can support more data throughput at a lower latency than the 2.4 GHz band. This is critical because video transmission requires &lt;em&gt;several orders of magnitude&lt;/em&gt; more data to be sent than RC controls and telemetry do because it sends entire pictures instead of a few numbers per transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Troubles With 2.4 GHz FPV Radios&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The need for more bandwidth in the 5.8 GHz range is further compounded by the fact that our analog FPV systems usually aren't frequency-hopping. In the old days of the RC hobby when airplanes were the only option, most RC transmitter/receiver systems had a fixed operating frequency. I have a couple of these transmitters, which actually have a slot where you need to insert a special crystal oscillator to select which frequency the transmitter uses!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This became a problem once people started coming together to fly and the RC hobby became more widespread. All of a sudden, people would begin turning on their transmitters at the flying field and their transmitter would talk over other people's transmitters using the same frequency, blasting them out of the sky and interrupting the controls to their plane. (&lt;em&gt;does this sound familiar? XD&lt;/em&gt;) This issue was worsened by the fact that the 2.4 GHz band we are allowed to use doesn't allow for very many non-overlapping channels and because the 2.4 GHz band is used by many other different kinds of devices and appliances which can also step on RC transmitters' signals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem, which has been implemented in the vast majority of all 2.4 GHz RC systems, is to implement frequency-hopping. This feature allows the RC system to dynamically switch between frequencies on the fly as needed, without any input required from the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These same issues caused by transmitters stomping on each others' signals are also a massive issue in the 5.8 GHz band, but to a far lesser extent due to the vast array of different non-overlapping channels available for use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/86qtw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/86qtw.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/526/97&quot;&gt;cit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditDate="2020-04-24T01:33:51.013" LastActivityDate="2020-04-24T01:33:51.013" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The reason I'm doing that is that answering the question &quot;why do some people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use those frequencies?&quot; can give us an insight into why the others do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's begin by listing the &quot;at least somewhat popular&quot; frequencies.&#xA;For video that would be 1.2, 2.4, and 5.8 GHz, and for control/telemetry links 72 MHz (analog), 433 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.4 GHz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first obvious thing about those bands is that most of these are &lt;strong&gt;ISM bands&lt;/strong&gt;. The ISM bands were originally intended as &quot;trash bands&quot; designated for non-telecommunications purposes, where all the industrial equipment such as radio-frequency heaters (think microwave ovens) could emit their RF radiation without interfering with any telecom bands. The most important thing about them for us, though, is that they are globally license-free and mostly unregulated, which basically means you can do about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; on them without requiring any kind of certification for your equipment as long as it only transmits within the band (and sometimes also doesn't exceed a certain maximum power level).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the relevant excerpt from the table of ISM bands in Wikipedia:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bfWd.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1bfWd.png&quot; alt=&quot;ISM bands&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;unregulated&quot; bit is key, since any bureaucratic process regarding radio frequency use is traditionally very long and rather expensive, and it has to be done in every country for every single model of your product. So the ISM bands had been quickly put to use by mass-produced cheap consumer devices that didn't care &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; if they got interfered with: Cordless phones, garage door openers, baby monitors, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi... RC systems continue this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, as you can see, the most popular bands, both for video and control/telemetry, are the &lt;strong&gt;highest&lt;/strong&gt; ones in their corresponding ranges. Why? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, as I discussed above, we're going to start with figuring out why they aren't the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why do people go lower?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first and very obvious boon is &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt;. While 2.4 GHz RC systems offer less than one kilometer of usable range, 900 MHz systems like Crossfire easily go several km on low power without even trying, and can reach tens of kilometers if configured properly. Same thing with video: lower-frequency systems are mainly used by long-range pilots seeking those few extra miles of coverage, and readily provide that additional range. Lower frequencies mean longer waves, and longer waves are easier to transmit further. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, they permit &lt;strong&gt;more transmitter power&lt;/strong&gt;: both in terms of regulations (maximum allowed power ratings tend to get lower as frequencies get higher) and in terms of technology as well, as lower-frequency radio amplifiers are &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt; and cheaper to build than higher-frequency ones, as is lower-frequency radio tech in general. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt; is not to be underestimated. It's one of the reasons why the old analog transmitters used 72 MHz: 72 MHz radio circuits are way simpler to manufacture with through-hole mounting, discrete components, etc etc, while high-frequency designs tend to require SMD components, their performance is heavily influenced by things like the shape of traces on the circuit board and the material of the PCB itself, and the process of designing such devices can be indistinguishable from black magic. 72 MHz systems didn't get much range, though, because... analog. Also, antennae. Also, no diversity. Also, lots of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of problems,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The drawbacks of lower frequencies.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Size.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first and very obvious one. Lower frequencies mean longer waves, and longer waves mean guess what? Longer antennae! Remember the huge extendable antennae of the old RC transmitters? That's 72 MHz for you! A 2.4G video antenna is going to be about 2.5x as large as a 5.8G one, and a 1.2G antenna almost 5x as large! Where a 2.4 GHz receiver antenna can easily stick out from almost any point on a 3&quot; quadcopter and not get in the way, a 900 MHz antenna is longer than the quad itself, and a good 433 MHz antenna would be closer to the size of a 6&quot; quadcopter! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a sneaky, but very important factor, especially for video. Any signal that carries data does not use just one frequency. Instead, it occupies a whole range of frequencies adjacent to the main one; for example, a basic AM voice signal transmitted at 10 MHz would actually take up the range of around 9.99 to 10.01 MHz, 10 kHz higher and lower than the main (&lt;em&gt;carrier&lt;/em&gt;) frequency. The size of that range is the &lt;em&gt;bandwidth&lt;/em&gt; of this signal, 20 kHz. This means that signals of this type must be spaced at least that amount apart to not interfere with each other. Voice is a relatively low-bandwidth type of data. As you push more information per second through a link, the bandwidth will increase, which means you have to space the links further out, which in turn means you can squeeze less of them into a certain frequency range. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the ISM bands (as well as any other radio bands) also have a certain width, the difference between the highest and lowest available frequencies, which you can see in the table above. And as you can see, as the frequency gets higher, the separation also gets bigger. The 900 Mhz band has merely a quarter of the bandwidth available in the 2.4G band, which in turn is 1.5 times smaller than that of the 5.8G band. While control links are affected (it's one of the reasons why you don't see a lot of 433M control systems around), they don't use nearly as much bandwidth as video. Analog TV (and video in general) has a notoriously high bandwidth: 6 _Mega_hertz. You can fit &lt;em&gt;several hundred&lt;/em&gt; voice signals in the space occupied by one TV signal! Because of that, analog TV had a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; chunk of the radio spectrum allocated to it: 54 to 890 MHz, for a ratio of highest to lowest frequency of more than 16x. Compare that to the ISM bands, where the top of the band is rarely more than a couple percent away from its bottom. You couldn't fit even &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; video channel into the whole 433 MHz band! So we use the higher bands out of necessity; the 2.4G band is really the lowest one that can fit a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; amount of video signals in it, and the 5.8G band can fit even more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Choices&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why isn't 2.4G the video standard? Well, it would interfere with our 2.4G control links (and they claimed the band before FPV became popular). Also, more bandwidth is better. Also, you love small video antennas, don't you?&#xA;Besides, using 5.8G is more responsible in general. There are way more different applications in the 2.4G band that you could stomp on with your huge video signal; 5.8 is considerably less popular, it's hard to find anything besides FPV or newer WiFi using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why not 24 GHz or higher? Welll... It's 5x more frequency, and things are getting well into &quot;black magic&quot; territory at above 1GHz already; at 24 GHz you could go crazy designing the gear and possibly just &lt;em&gt;attaching the antenna to your quad&lt;/em&gt;. And it would be several times as expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the last consideration, about 2.4 gigahertz specifically, and why I think it was chosen as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; digital RC band. And that, besides the huge bandwidth and conveniently small antennae, is... cheap WiFi chips. Most 2.4G RC systems use one of four 2.4 GHz digital radio microchips: NRF24L01, A7105, CC2500, or CYRF6936. Each of those is &lt;em&gt;a fully-featured 2.4 GHz transceiver in one chip&lt;/em&gt;, which you could put on a board, plug an antenna into one end, an Arduino into the other, and voila, you've got an RC controller! Or a receiver. Or WiFi/Bluetooth/whatever dongle. That's literally what the multiprotocol module is, by the way: all 4 of those chips, one microcontroller, and some clever schematics so that they could share an antenna, in one enclosure. Anyway, chips like these make creating digital 2.4GHz radio equipment extremely easy compared to the usual black magic, and thanks to WiFi and other 2.4 GHz tech the chips themselves are really inexpensive. And THAT, I think, is the deciding factor. Because who doesn't love cheap transmitters and receivers at 10$ a pop?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-24T01:44:39.013" LastActivityDate="2020-04-24T01:44:39.013" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A larger drone will normally need more space to fly and can cause more damage if crashed. I would recommend a small drone if you are just starting out or if you can only fly indoors, in which case you would want a tiny whoop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next thing I would think about is cost. A larger drone will be much more expensive for the drone itself, the propellers, the parts (frame, electronics, etc.), and especially batteries. While a larger drone may have slightly longer flight times, one battery for a large drone might cost 10 times as much as a battery for a small drone. So, with smaller drones, you can get more flight time per dollar of battery. (you can buy 4-6 small batteries for the price of one large battery and get a lot more flight time for the same amount of money). So, if you're on a budget, I definitely recommend a small drone. It's also worth mentioning that larger drones usually use batteries with more cells so they can be more dangerous if they catch on fire or puff up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, there is flight performance. Generally, it is true that a smaller drone is more nimble than a large drone, although Larger drones are usually capable of much higher top-speeds. I must say though, after having lots of experience with different drones I much prefer the performance of a large, powerful drone to a small drone because small drones often suffer from lots of battery sag due to the lower battery voltages and so they cannot sustain high throttle as well. Also, a larger drone can carry a GoPro or other camera with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in the end:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a small drone if:&lt;/strong&gt; you only have a small area, you only have a little bit of money, you are very worried about damaging something, you want a lot of flight time for less money, or if you just don't want a big drone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a larger drone if:&lt;/strong&gt; You have enough space and money, you want high performance/top speed, you want something that can lift a GoPro/camera/payload, or if you just want a larger drone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="170" LastActivityDate="2020-04-24T04:12:14.510" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A gain is a ratio: If a device takes a voltage on one end and makes it 20x larger (&lt;em&gt;amplifies&lt;/em&gt;) it 20-fold, it has a gain of 20. In practice these are measured in decibels; see the note at the end of this answer for more information about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the gain of an antenna is the ratio of how much stronger the radio waves generated by the antenna are relative to those generated by some kind of &lt;em&gt;baseline antenna&lt;/em&gt;, when you put a unit of power into both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The baseline antenna is considered to have a gain of 0 dB, or 1:1 (equal to itself), and there are two options that are commonly used for this: An &lt;em&gt;ideal isotropic&lt;/em&gt; antenna, which radiates equally in all directions with zero losses, or a &lt;em&gt;dipole&lt;/em&gt; antenna. To indicate which one is used, a letter is added to the end: dBi represents gain relative to an isotropic antenna, and dBd relative to a dipole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dipole itself has a gain of 2.15 dBi (and 0 dBd), so to convert a dBi number to dBd you subtract 2.15 from it, and add the same number to convert the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, as a simple example, if the gain of your antenna is 3 dBi (which corresponds to a 2:1 ratio), its signals will be twice as strong as those of the ideal isotropic antenna. However, there is a caveat, which boils down to: &lt;em&gt;There ain't such thing as a free lunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;em&gt;isotropic antennae do not exist in the real world&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. no real antenna radiates equally strong in all directions. There are directions in which it will radiate the strongest, and others in which it doesn't radiate at all. So the gain of the antenna is not the same in all directions as well: in some it is stronger, in some it is weaker. The easiest way to show this is a graph showing the antenna’s gain in any direction around the antenna. That graph is called a &lt;em&gt;radiation pattern&lt;/em&gt; and looks like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3oIi.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3oIi.png&quot; alt=&quot;azimuthal pattern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bold line represents the gain: the further it is from the center, the bigger the gain. Above is the radiation pattern of a &lt;em&gt;directional&lt;/em&gt; antenna: the gain in one direction is a lot more than in other directions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when we speak of an antenna's gain, we really mean its gain &lt;em&gt;in a certain direction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And that direction is usually the one in which the antenna's gain is the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, you can't get more out of an antenna than you put into it. The sum of all power radiated in all directions is always equal to the power that goes in (Minus a small percentage of losses)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum those two points up, An antenna can create gain by radiating radio waves that add together in the preferred direction and cancel in others. If an antenna has a higher than baseline (positive) gain in some direction, you pay for that by having a negative gain in other directions. &lt;strong&gt;Gain only focuses power — it does not create power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So gain is not only the measure of how well an antenna receives or transmits, it's also a measure of the antenna's &lt;em&gt;directivity&lt;/em&gt;: If the antenna focuses all of its power in a tight cone, it will have a huge gain within that cone, and a huge gain rating on the box... But its gain outside of that cone will be almost nonexistent. So when you are choosing a directional antenna, the gain is also an indication &lt;em&gt;how directional&lt;/em&gt; it really is. Lower-gain patch antennae will give you a soft, forgiving cone but lower gain in it, while high-gain directionals will have a very tight zone in which they transmit or receive at all, but within it they will be super powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Omnidirectional antennae (which, as you now know, are never &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; omnidirectional) have a radiation pattern that's more or less shaped like a donut:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/il1BR.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/il1BR.png&quot; alt=&quot;dipole pattern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have an equal (and high) gain in any direction perpendicular to the antenna, which gets lower as the direction gets closer to parallel to the antenna. These antennae &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; have their own kind of directivity: if you mount the antenna vertically, the &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; gain will be the same in any direction, but it can be higher or lower relative to the &amp;quot;more vertical&amp;quot; directions, making the donut flatter. In other words, the antenna can prioritize gain towards the horizon more or less versus overhead gain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;every antenna receives the same way as it transmits&lt;/em&gt;. An antenna with 2x gain in a certain direction will transmit 2x the power in that direction, but also radio waves coming &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; this direction will generate 2x stronger signals for a connected receiver to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A note on decibels&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many engineering fields ratios can easily get extremely large or extremely minuscule and tend to multiply a lot, and radio is one of the most prominent of those. At the input to a receiver, signals are frequently&#xA;smaller than one ten-billionth of a watt. When they come out of a transmitter, they’re often measured in kilowatts! Antennas, propagation and electronic circuits change signal strengths by many factors of ten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To manage these vast differences in value, engineers measure ratios in &lt;em&gt;decibels&lt;/em&gt;, or dB, which represent the ratio of&#xA;two quantities as a power of 10. The formula for computing decibels is:&#xA;dB = 10 * log_10 (ratio)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;logarithmic&lt;/em&gt; unit, meaning that when two ratios are multiplied, their representations in dB are simply added up: 10 decibels represent a ratio of 10:1; 20 dB is 10*10=100:1, and 30dB is 1000:1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Positive values of dB mean the ratio is greater than 1 and negative values of dB indicate a ratio of less than 1: -10 dB represents a ratio of 1/10, and 40dB is 1/10000.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick cheat sheet of dB to actual ratio for numbers smaller than 10:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1dB corresponds to about 1.25:1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3dB is almost exactly 2:1&lt;/strong&gt; (this is the most important one to remember)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7dB ~= 5:1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10dB is 10:1&lt;/strong&gt; (exactly)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For everything else, you just add up the numbers you know:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6dB (=3dB+3dB) is ~ 4(=2*2):1, and 9dB is ~ 8:1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;13 dB is 10 dB + 3 dB, so 10*2=20:1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;46 dB is 40 dB + 6 dB = 10^4 * 4 = 40000:1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;15 dB is 10dB + 5dB; and 5 dB is somewhere between 3dB and 6dB (2 and 4), so it's probably three point something.

However, theoretical calculations will usually be such a crude approximation of reality that you can't rely on them, and the actual maximum range will depend on a myriad of factors besides what you can consider in the approximation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're flying short-range, near obstacles (or inside of them!), doing acrobatic maneuvers, etc, the local conditions, attitude of your drone, its proximity to things, etc &lt;em&gt;at each particular moment&lt;/em&gt; will affect the performance of your video link orders of magnitude more than any theoretical range. Things such as where your antennae are pointed and how directional they are, what kind of noise reduction your receiver has, and where you are standing suddenly become extremely important and intimately connected to the configuration of the building or other environment that you're flying. Sometimes, just moving your receiver several centimeters to the side could make a huge difference in the clarity of the received signal, or lowering your transmitter's power can make the link perform &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; due to less multipath interference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what people usually do is they have some known values of range and general performance for certain combinations of gear, and they consider how much a certain &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; to that gear will affect this performance. As in, swapping a 3dB antenna for an 11dB option might give you an 8dB stronger signal, which corresponds to 4dB (~2.5x) more range in open air versus the alternative &lt;em&gt;under the same conditions&lt;/em&gt;; or it might give you the ability to punch through &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; wall (while your less-directional omni antenna covers the rest of your surroundings). Maybe upping the VTX power twofold could give you sqrt(2)=1.41x more range even through that wall. Or it might give you more interference instead. So after making that hypothesis, you implement the change, go and test it and see if it really works this way; It might or it might not!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now comes the nerdy part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know the exact formula you're speaking about, but I'm going to reason my way through this just for kicks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, our goal is to have a signal at the receiver that's higher than its sensitivity (which represents the weakest signal that the receiver can detect and demodulate). Our signal path is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Original signal -&amp;gt; transmitter's amplifier gain -&amp;gt; (feedline loss) -&amp;gt; TX antenna gain -&amp;gt; path loss from travel between antennas -&amp;gt; RX antenna gain -&amp;gt; (preamp?) -&amp;gt; receiver.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(scroll it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The signal is multiplied at every step except where it is reduced while traveling through the air, so we need the product of all gains multiplied by the loss factor to be higher than the sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So our max-range equation is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AmpGain*Gain1*Gain2*PathLoss = RxSens.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest, ideal case, where we assume that there's nothing around except the two antennas (&lt;em&gt;free space&lt;/em&gt;), the losses from transmission are inverse-square: &#xA;FSPL = wavelength/(4Pi * distance²), from which we get:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AllGains*wavelength/(4Pi * Distance²) = RxSens;&#xA;4Pi * Distance² = AllGains*wavelength/RxSens;&#xA;MaxDistance = sqrt(AllGains*wavelength/(4Pi*RxSens)).&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here comes the caveat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;We don't live in an ideal world.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're not transmitting in free space. There might be buildings or trees or &lt;em&gt;rain&lt;/em&gt; or anything else in the way, too. Worse, it &lt;em&gt;doesn't even have to block your line of sight&lt;/em&gt;, as objects &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt; the line will cause diffraction of your signal which can interfere with your reception if they are within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;fresnel zone&lt;/a&gt;.

It will probably start to corrupt the signal in various ways as you approach its sensitivity level. You're unlikely to ever see this, however, because long before it reaches that critical stat of your receiver, your precious signal will drown in...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Noise.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noise is the worst enemy of anyone working with high-gain systems. It's the third law of thermodynamics personified. Thousands of manmade and natural radiation sources around the planet bombard everything around with random radio waves. Even if you exclude those, outer space is actually quite noisy as well. Your receiver itself generates noise internally; in fact, for most gear including your receiver sensitivity itself is defined by that internal noise level. Still, external noise tends to be orders of magnitude more powerful, and whatever the source, you don't want any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The total strength of noise as received by your gear is called the &lt;em&gt;noise floor&lt;/em&gt;, and that floor is lava. No matter how sensitive the receiver, the moment your signal level dips below the noise floor, it's gone: still out there, but you can't tell it apart from the noise to decode it properly anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBMRC.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBMRC.png&quot; alt=&quot;noise floor illustration&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the nature of your signal, it can even become totally unintelligible &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it reaches the noise floor, at several dB above it. Usually, the higher a signal's bandwidth (which is closely linked to data transmission rate), the sooner it's overcome by noise. Some advanced digital transmission modes can extract a message from well &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; the noise floor, but in order to do that they transmit several bytes &lt;em&gt;per minute&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video is a notoriously high-bandwidth type of data, both in the internet and in radio. Analog video especially so, as it has zero compression. So it gets disrupted by noise rather easily. On the other hand, zero compression implies lots of redundancy in the data, and redundancy allows for error correction. Do you know what's one of the best signal processing and error correction machines in the world? The human brain! Even when a video signal is almost entirely eaten up by static, we can still see shapes in it. So for video, the intelligibility threshold seems to be just at the noise floor mark, give or take a couple dB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; fight noise in various ways. Usually, if most of it is coming from certain sources on the ground, just using a directional antenna helps by attenuating signals from unwanted directions. Sometimes, if the noise is just the regular background entropy kind, it doesn't. A good frequency selectivity of your receiver (i.e. its ability to ignore signals that aren´t the target frequency) also helps tremendously. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting way of fighting noise is signal-stacking, as done by receivers like RapidFire or True-D X: Instead of simply switching to the antenna with the highest signal, they use signals from &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; and merge them into one. Since the useful signal is the same and noise is random, the signal adds up while the noise mostly cancels out. Astrophotographers &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonrista.com/the-astrophotographers-guide/astrophotography-basics/snr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;use the same technique&lt;/a&gt; to get stunning clear pictures of the sky, except that they have to stack &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of extremely noisy photos. The digital communication modes I mentioned earlier also work this way by sending multiple copies of the same transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhaET.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhaET.png&quot; alt=&quot;garbage math 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video is still a high-bandwidth signal, however, and you've only got two copies of it to stack, so the gains from the likes of Rapidfire are far from dramatic, but it'll win you a couple of additional dB over the noise floor. Beware, though: such receivers depend on a special sync signal in the video to do the adding correctly, and when the noise eats &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;... You'll probably get a blank screen. &#xA;That's a common caveat with any technology that does the error correction for you, by the way, including digital video: it gives a cleaner and more pleasant signal while it does, but will probably give up before you do. So this kind of error correction might not be the best for very long-range flights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Final word&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To appreciate the sheer expanse of outcomes that you might possibly encounter once you start pushing the range envelope, it's probably best to look at ham radio operators. &#xA;On one end, they will casually use 50-watt transmitters to just talk locally within a range of no more than several tens of kilometers, and sometimes use kilowatts to punch through unfavorable conditions. On the other end, they can literally talk to the other side of the earth on fractions of a watt and bounce signals off of the Moon. They've been doing all of that crazy stuff for decades and had invented things that were thought impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the reason for all of those achievements is lots and lots of experimentation. Without testing what works and what doesn't, a theory is useless. So, if you decide to jump down this rabbit hole, start to think like a ham. Make that estimate to the best of your ability, assemble what you think should work best, and then go out and fly it. See how it works in reality, and how it differs from your expectations. Make hypotheses. Go out on different days and in different places to see how the conditions change your outcome. Then change something in your system and see what happens. Write it down. Make your own theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, most important of all,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have fun!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-26T11:27:54.103" LastActivityDate="2020-04-26T11:27:54.103" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It allows simple &quot;in the moment&quot; tuning of the performance.  while flying.  Most prebuilt or toy grade quads will have this option on the controller labeled in some 'creative' fashion like 'fine-tuning' or whatever.  However, they are often guilty of offering virtually no explanation of the feature and its usage, or the instructions are so badly converted from Chinese that they make so real sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Others have posted here that you can just nudge your craft's point of balance in a hover in any direction you need to.  If it's pulling left, you trim it right, etc..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, many quads are affected by the following details:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trim settings are often lost/forgotten/reset after powering down the craft.  They are not saved as the unit calibrates on every power-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight controllers on most craft will actually do a level accelerometer calibration on the gyro when first powering up.  So if you place the quad on a non-level surface and power it up, it will have an improper tune as it will &quot;zero&quot; the gyro to that angle and tend to drift (which of course can be compensated for using trim if needed.)  Many instructions will vaguely say: &quot;place the copter on a flat surface when powering up&quot; or some terrible translation of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My son and I currently have 3 small &quot;store-bought&quot; quads we use for practicing/indoor flight and they are all different makes and models but they all exhibit this exact kind of behavior so I have to think it's a standard approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a hobby-grade mainstream flight controller, the calibration setting is usually stored and only needs to be done once.  I do this on my large quad by completely physically leveling it on the bench using a carpenters level on both forward/reverse and left/right axis (shimming it up with paper/pennies etc until is completely level) then, in the software, run the &quot;calibrate accelerometer&quot; option which takes about 2 seconds and then stores it in the flight controller.  After that, you are good and should NOT run it again unless you change something physical in the copter.  This done right will ideally make you able to fly well with zero trim adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all, of course, depends on the quadcopter you have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user251" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-04-27T03:49:17.327" LastActivityDate="2020-04-27T03:49:17.327" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you're buying, patch is usually better simply in terms of size and toughness. However, consider DIYing a helical; it's cheaper, a nice project to do, and makes a very good antenna. Only &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a premade helical if you wanna do very long range flights and don't want to bother with making one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you only consider the strictly RF differences between these antenna classes, they are rather subtle. These indeed are both directional antennae, and the directivity for both classes can be varied in a rather wide range depending on the particular variant of the antenna. A helical antenna would get longer as its directivity increases, while a patch would get wider. One thing that may or may not be significant is that helical antennae tend to have a very symmetrical radiation pattern, i.e. a very round beam, while the radiation pattern of patch antennae tends to flare out slightly more to certain sides. This can be significant if you're using highly-directional versions and need to point your antenna to keep your aircraft inside its cone; for a helical antenna the gain reduction would be the same no matter in which direction the antenna is misaligned, it would only depend on &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; it's misaligned. For a patch antenna the direction contributes as well, though maybe subtly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, there's not much to say. While in theory a helical antenna is slightly more efficient, in practice each antenna's efficiency would depend more on the design and fabrication of the particular antenna than on its class. Speaking of fabrication, I must also point out here that since patch antennae are PCBs, and helical antennae are likely at least in part assembled by hand, I would expect the characteristics of patches to be a bit more consistent antenna to antenna within the same model/manufacturer. You probably wouldn't notice either way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more significant characteristics are dimensions, endurance and ease of manufacture.&#xA;In the first two, patch antennae win by a long margin; they are both more compact and harder to damage in transportation or rough handling. For ease of manufacture... it depends. If you're looking at producing thousands of them, the patch also wins unequivocally, as it's just a PCB that can be automated and made very consistently and cheaply. If you need just one or two, however... The helical is far ahead. It's a very simple design that doesn't depend on things like copper thickness or &lt;strong&gt;the grade of material of the circuit board&lt;/strong&gt;, its directivity can be easily set as needed by simply changing the number of turns and without recalculating anything, and it is very easy and cheap to manufacture at home using a minimum of parts and tools; the rarest of them is probably the coax connector and maybe the wire former (if you don't have plastic tubing of the right diameter or a 3D printer); the rest of the materials are probably already lying somewhere around your house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I were to recommend, then:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you're flying near yourself, don't want to worry about transporting/damaging it or want a premade antenna, go for a patch.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you're willing to make one and/or you want to do very long range flights, AND you're okay with it being a bit bulky and less durable, helical is better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-04-27T22:32:26.577" LastActivityDate="2020-04-27T22:32:26.577" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is also incredibly difficult to decouple effects of batteries and propellers in concert with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally the wider stator is capable of greater instantaneous torque, and can generate a proportionately larger initial RPM change within a small time period, which typically results in faster thrust changes in response to FC-&gt;ESC commanded changes.  The relative efficiency curve (when taking into account battery response) with most propellers mean that for a similar volume of stator, a wider and shorter motor will produce its most efficient thrust in the low-mid throttle range compared to a narrower and taller stator.&#xA;At higher RPM, the taller stators tend to retain more efficiency, which as battery limitations become involved mean there is greater overall thrust at higher RPM ranges which effectively closes the gap for torque response, and why simplifying this into terms of 'torque' is often misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are various workarounds to changing this response - specifying higher voltage batteries and utilizing less of the available power can cover for many of these differences because higher input voltage increases the amount of instantaneous torque available for any motor configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, when discussing which propellers pair best with specifically sized stators, in my personal experience the propellers with more chord (thicker blades) respond excellently and pair brilliantly with wider stators (e.g. 2306.5 and HQ V2S props), while the narrower chord props that respond through bigger RPM deltas tend to produce more consistent responses with taller stators (e.g. 2207 with Gemfan/TMotor props) to achieve a good control feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadening this discussion to other ranges of propellers &amp;amp; motor size, these trends persist, but quite often other factors can become more significant (in very lightweight 65mm-3&quot; setups, battery performance and FC response can play a larger role, as can craft all-up weight.  In 7&quot; and larger quads, the wider variance in prop weight/pitch/chord/responsiveness means stators can vary widely with differing results, but significant overlap in what works well (e.g. 2212 and 2806.5 motors being able to use the same props despite disparate stator dimensions.  Depending on the intended RPM range, quite often the tendency for wider stators to have a large efficiency 'hump' near the 30-60% throttle range works to their benefit.  Similarly, on racing craft where the histogram of throttle percentage is often in the 50-80% range, 7-8mm tall stators (or taller for macroquads) tends to perform best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="81" LastActivityDate="2020-04-28T19:03:51.073" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The bigger the prop, the more weight-to-power (efficiency) ratio increases.

Many camera drones, such as the DJI Phantom, still use that plastic construction to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was also fairly common to build airframes out of wood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in more recent years, carbon fibre has become the gold standard in terms of weight, strength and price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Smaller drones, such as Tiny Whoops, as well as toy grade quads may still use plastic as they often don’t have the mass to break plastic frames during a crash, and if you are okay with the risk that a crash at sufficient velocity could destroy your airframe, moulded plastic may be a good option (I say moulded as 3D printed is unlikely to have the required strength).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You say you have tried aluminium, however there is an important distinction to make.

If you're looking for performance, there's no way around it. If performance is not the most important thing in the world, however... Well, there are several options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I start listing these, I must point out that &lt;em&gt;all frames break&lt;/em&gt;. Some break more easily than others, but you can't have an unbreakable frame. The question is how you repair it &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; it breaks, and the answer depends on the material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic frames&lt;/strong&gt; are actually a very popular in micro-sized quadcopters that only weigh tens of grams. These frames usually feature a non-flat shape, prop guards and other features built into them. A subset of those, 3D printed frames, are also quite widely used in DIY designs of larger sizes, and, as everything 3D printed, are a good way of prototyping your design before moving on to other materials. In some cases, where performance is not a concern (for example, if your main focus is having a platform for testing algorithms for which flight time or range is not important at the time, or just want to play around with a design) you may even never move on from a 3D printed frame. While these tend to be heavy and/or brittle compared to other materials, there are some exceptionally light designs, and depending on the intended applications, durability might not be a concern. Besides, if you do break one of these, you can always just print a new one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wood and metal/fiberglass&lt;/strong&gt; is a staple of &quot;oldschool&quot;, large (8&quot;+) DIY drones from the KK2/Naze era. As the drone gets larger, heavier frames tend to impede it less, and any crash could easily break an arm just due to the sheer weight of the drone, no matter what the arm is made of. So this kind of design focuses on repairability instead: one can easily make tens of wooden arms in their workshop for very cheap and swap them when they break. Potentially, one could try to make a smaller wooden frame as well, although at this point lightness becomes important, so I'd advise to stick to lighter woods if you do, maybe even balsa. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Full-metal frames are not unheard of as well; Aluminium and titanium are widely-accepted building materials in aviation and actually tend to have better performance than wood. You'll have to use tubes/other non-flat shapes, though.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even though you've ruled out carbon fiber, you may be referring specifically to CNC machining of frames out of flat sheets. Premade carbon fiber elements such as strips and tubing are readily available for order online and are easy to work with using basic tools. A lot of larger drones today are made using the same basic technologies as the wood/metal drones of old, but with arms out of carbon fiber tubes instead of wooden planks. If you're building a large drone, this is a very feasible yet high-performance option.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Pure fiberglass composite&lt;/strong&gt;. Glass fiber composites are significantly less stiff than their carbon fiber counterparts, and heavier as well, but there are a few niche uses even in performance designs. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first of them is very large drones, which tend not to care as much about neither weight nor aerobatic performance. Here, glass fiber can shine if you've got the facilities to manufacture it. That said, if you're building a very large drone, the frame is likely to be a very small fraction of its cost, so you might just as well order a custom carbon design (or use premade carbon parts like the previous option).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The more interesting option, however, is a &lt;strong&gt;PCB frame&lt;/strong&gt;, in which the frame is&#xA;not just a structural component, but also carries all the electronics&#xA;that the drone needs to fly. Some fantastically lightweight designs&#xA;have been made using this technique: even though the glass fiber&#xA;itself is heavier than carbon, the design makes up for it by ditching&#xA;all the other PCB and wiring weight that would otherwise be carried&#xA;&lt;em&gt;on top&lt;/em&gt; of the frame in a traditional design. While not optimal for sporty flying, this is the perfect option for a long-range/long&#xA;flight time autonomous design... if you can lay out the PCB, as all&#xA;of the components (flight controller, ESCs, vTX, etc) have to be&#xA;integrated into it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Some examples for inspiration:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Plastic frames&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brushed micro quadcopter (tiny whoop) with molded plastic frame:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/70kdE.png&quot;

Balance is not that much of an issue (that's what the I term is for), unless you're doing the highest performance flying, in which case you should just replace the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, in order to not lose current sensing on the new ESC, it can pay to solder your new ESC's power leads directly to the VBAT power traces after the shunt resistor on the 4-in-1 (they are usually exposed and sometimes even have metal rails soldered to them). If you don't want to bother or aren't that good at soldering, you can usually make do without rewiring the extra ESC, and just adjust the current sensor multiplier. This isn't going to give you as precise a reading, but it's an okay approximation for gauging general current usage and deciding when to land, just don't rely on it too much. Multiply the number by 3/4 (or less, depending on how many surviving ESCs you have on the same board) for a first estimate, and maybe later make a finer adjustment by measuring the true mAh used from the pack vs. used mAh indicated in the OSD.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two more interesting ways to make use of a damaged 4-in-1, however. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first one is similar to what ifconfig is suggesting, but instead of adding a standalone ESC, you add &lt;em&gt;another 4-in-1&lt;/em&gt; to the same stack, and wire it to the same flight controller (but to different motor pins, of course). For this you can even use another damaged ESC, as not all of the individual ESCs on the board may be used. This also gets rid of the balance problem if it bothers you somehow, and also lets you avoid clipping the wires of one of your motors shorter in order to accomodate the individual ESC. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same caveat applies about current sensors as with an individual ESC, and it's going to be harder to wire the two power rails together, so you're probably stuck with using just one of the current sensors and adjusting the multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second, and more advanced, is to just replace the damaged component on your ESC. It is usually one (or several) of the power transistors (FETs) of the ESC, and those can be easily replaced if you know how to use a heat gun. You'll need the replacements however. Most FETs used in popular 4-in-1s can be ordered, so it's a question of identifying the part number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastActivityDate="2020-04-28T22:58:47.497" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Signal reception between linearly polarized antennae oriented with an angle between them of θ will fall off with a polarization loss factor (&lt;em&gt;PLF&lt;/em&gt;) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antenna-theory.com/basics/polarization.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PLF = cos^2 (θ)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and reception will be zero when the antennae are perpendicular to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Circular → Circular&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As long as the circular polarization is identical (&lt;em&gt;RHCP or LHCP&lt;/em&gt;) between the two antennae, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antenna-theory.com/basics/polarization.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;no signal loss will be observed due to the polarization of the antennae&lt;/a&gt;. Signal strength isn't dependent on the angle between the orientations of the circularly polarized antennae. However, if you aren't using omnidirectional antennae (&lt;em&gt;e.g. mushroom&lt;/em&gt;)¹ and instead have a directional antenna (&lt;em&gt;e.g. patch, helical&lt;/em&gt;), you must point the directional antenna in the direction of the other antenna to have the most gain. (&lt;em&gt;see &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/835/what-is-antenna-gain&quot;&gt;&quot;What is antenna gain?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Within the beam width of the directional ciruclarly polarized antenna, orientation doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/896/97&quot;&gt;pointed out by @FlashCactus&lt;/a&gt;, only circular → circular polarization matches benefit from the multipath interference reduction effect. This is because circularly polarized waves switch polarization when they bounce off of an obstruction (&lt;em&gt;i.e. RHCP → LHCP and vice versa&lt;/em&gt;), so duplicate signals taking an odd number of bounces to reach the receiver will be ignored by the antenna. (&lt;em&gt;they will be recieved as the opposite polarization with which they were transmitted&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more details on how circular polarization works, I (&lt;em&gt;and @FlashCactus&lt;/em&gt;) recommend having a look at this question: &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/120/what-is-circular-polarization-in-antennas&quot;&gt;What is circular polarization in antennas?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;¹: Omnidirectional antennae are also not truly omnidirectional; they have a region of low gain along their axis, and will transmit/receive poorly in that direction. It is best to face them sideways towards the other antenna for best reception. The same is true for linear antennae; they receive&amp;amp;transmit best from their sides and worst along the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Circular → Linear&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because a circularly polarized wave can also be represented by two 90° out-of-phase perpendicular linearly polarized waves, the linear antenna &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antenna-theory.com/basics/polarization.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;will receive with a signal strength reduction (&lt;em&gt;PLF&lt;/em&gt;) of half&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;or -3dB&lt;/em&gt;). Signal strength isn't dependent on the angle between the orientations of the linearly polarized and circularly polarized antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This configuration can be useful if you want to spectate someone who has the opposite transmitting antenna handedness from you (LHCP while you use RHCP, for example), or to scan the radio spectrum that might contain signals of different polarization (RHCP, LHCP or linear) without switching the antenna: A linear antenna will receive both RHCP and LHCP signals equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Linear → Circular&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise from before, because the circularly polarized antenna is built to receive both perpendicular components of the circularly polarized wave, it will receive a linearly polarized wave with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antenna-theory.com/basics/polarization.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;a signal strength reduction (&lt;em&gt;PLF&lt;/em&gt;) of half (&lt;em&gt;-3dB&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;.

As with the opposite configuration, RHCP and LHCP antennae will receive linearly polarized signals equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This configuration can be commonly seen in the case of micro-quads like Tinywhoops which only come with linearly polarized transmitter antennae.

However, as the frequencies are shared there are laws in each country&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; which limit the maximum power you can use; this prevents it becoming a 'free for all' for who can push the most power out, which would cause interference issues for everyone. This is also more costly on battery life, so there is a trade off particularly on the airborne segment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a selection of frequencies available for use on commercial drones - again, this varies slightly by country&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A 7 inch prop, however, needs to spin &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than a 5 inch prop, so also needs lower KV motors if you use same-voltage batteries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are some caveats to this simplistic view. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, characteristic RPMs are dependent on a lot of factors other than prop size (which is why it's only a ballpark). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, RPMs are generally an uncommon stat in hobbyist circles; it seems that no one really measures RPM other than super nerdy types with thrust stands (although that might change soon with the advent of bidirectional DSHOT), so you're unlikely to come by a list of those for different prop sizes. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And finally, the relationship itself is more complicated. For example, it's now well known that higher cell counts tend to tolerate (and even &quot;like&quot;) higher KV motors that simple scaling would suggest: 2450KV scaled down 1.5x is about 1600, but the actual sweet spot for 6S is higher, around 1800. Why? Well, there's a lot of speculation about the contribution of the battery's chemistry and how it reacts to higher currents, coil resistance and other factors, but the truth is, no one knows. It just works like that. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in the end, the best way seems to be to just look at what others are doing if you want to get something that works, and experiment if you want to maybe get something that works better :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastActivityDate="2020-05-01T05:34:18.563" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

In most practical terms, batteries will never be producing rated full charged voltage in these scenarios (quite often much closer to 3.7-3.9V in actual wide open throttle scenarios on fresh charges - and this is as the props unload allowing the battery to recover slightly), and the actual achieved RPM will correspondingly drop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are additional pragmatic considerations that need to be taken into the initial consideration, the most important of which are what propellers are to be used, and what stators are going to be paired with those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The largest driving consideration is one that makes intuitive sense, but the primacy of it isn't necessarily intuitive:  it is that higher KV motors enable (but do not require) larger wattage draw from the battery as an overall system.  Higher KV motors will convert this power into thrust, and have much greater top end capability, but the cost is always battery amperage in each given case, and particularly where thrust grows as a relationship to RPM^2, this current draw growth (and eventually additional thermal resistance losses) are what becomes the limit.  Battery chemistry and its interaction IS a known quantity, but the non-linear relationship and multivariate response to this makes it challenging to usefully estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Practically, the reason not to run the lowest KV possible is that the flight dynamics benefit from having overhead for demanded thrust and additional ability to modulate the overall thrust available without reducing thrust from the other [N-1] motors to retain attitude control.  Particularly because these edge case limitations occur when demanding maximum performance (or else the craft will crash), overhead is basically always desired, but the cost of this overhead is quite often the ability to push the overall powertrain to very high exertion points, which reduces flight time and part life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In racing considerations where maximum speed is going to be tied to a practical limit (i.e. where additional speed is unlikely to be gained through having additional motor RPM possible at higher KV, but the props or battery will not sustain that), there are some quick guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General RPM targets are about 38k RPM for 5&quot; quads, which grows towards 52k RPM in high speed 3&quot; quads, and drops into the 26k regime&lt;/strong&gt; &#xA;While this isn't a hard &amp;amp; fast rule to be followed, and quite often optimally performing racing setups will exceed these values, but with very specific goals of maximizing responsiveness in instances where the motor RPM isn't at redline, but to maximize available thrust and responsiveness of the powertrain in mid-throttle high load situations common in racing courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other key trends to consider are how stator dimensions and props interact.  Lower pitch props obviously benefit from higher RPM, and can produce extremely precise three-axis control through maintaining higher RPM while gaining better thrust resolution at each corner, but the cost is typically small losses in efficiency.  Higher pitch props, somewhat paradoxically, are often more efficient when paired with lower KV motors, though the result if typically slightly damped craft response in propwash environments.&#xA;Stator dimensions and the propeller chord (thickness of blades) also plays a significant response - lower surface area props paired with taller stators respond very well with a smoothed linear response and make use of the taller stator tendency to work well at higher RPM, while thicker chord props paired with wider stators do a great job of managing the extra rotational inertia of the propeller and produce a remarkably smooth response across the most typically used thrust band. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, being able to visualize a histogram of throttle inputs can help determine this significantly - something that spends the majority of its time in the 30-60% throttle may benefit from lower KV and/or lower pitch props, but to retain the grip selecting higher effective surface are props work extremely well.  For something that spends lots of time above 60% throttle, higher KV despite the drawbacks makes sense, and pairing that with taller stators and thinner chord props can regain some of the responsiveness without making the current draw excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="81" LastActivityDate="2020-05-05T14:56:24.637" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

You'll want to get the antennas as far away from the frame as you can so that the frame can never block at least on antenna from seeing your transmitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you are considering ways to mount your antennas on a miniquad however there isn't one &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to mount them. Range, quad orientation and durability all play a part in what will work best for you. That said there are two things you should know to understand about antenna placement and why the 90 setup is recommended for range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reason for two antennas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The XM+ antennas both have the same function. The receiver simply compares their signal strength and picks which one is best. This lets you place them in different orientations so that depending on your orientation on antenna or the other will have adequate signal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The radiation pattern.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally the monopole antenna has it's best signal reception at a direction that's perpendicular to the antenna itself. Conversely it suffers from pretty bad reception in the top and bottom directions. This image shows the typical radiation pattern. Imagine the wire antenna standing straight up inside this donut. The red directions have good reception and the green are where it is bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/opgFR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/opgFR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;radiation pattern&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, since you have two antennas you can see how rotating the second one by 90 degrees would cover the deadspots of the first antenna.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYcnn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/bYcnn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rotated radiation pattern&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two orientations make for good coverage in almost any orientation. However, it's not perfect, those donuts are pretty flat. Mounting both antennas in a more upright 'V' orientation could provide a lot more even coverage, but only if you don't plan on doing something like diving straight down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, realize that those nice donut patterns can be blocked by your frame if they are placed in such a way that the frame can come inbetween you and the antenna. You can see how this would happen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/979/10&quot;&gt;Paul's example&lt;/a&gt;. Not to say that's a bad way to do it. I do it that way often. For typical park rages it still gives you that 90 degree orientation and will protect your antennas from prop strikes and crashes more effectively.

So at the risk of stating the obvious, propeller design is a study of the tradeoffs and compromises required to make something practical. Here's a list of some compromises:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;length: landing gear height (or water depth) restricts how long a blade can be. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;material constraints: thicker airfoils resist forces better. Stronger materials allow for thinner airfoils while still meeting required blade strength&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;power-plant constraints: the torque required to spin the propeller should match the motor/engine's efficiency and power curves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;number of blades: more blades equal more thrust for a same diameter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;increased activity factor (aka blade width): wider blades produce more thrust for the same diameter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;balancing: one prop is very hard to balance without causing lots of drag by the opposing mass.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vibration: three props give fewer vibrations than two&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sound pollution: smaller props spinning more slowly are more pleasing on the ear&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;consumer perception: consumers like to see big blades in their fans, regardless of real-world efficiency and performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;density of the fluid: &#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dense fluids such as water can cause cavitation, which can quickly  damage the propeller.

If the motor accelerates, the props lower angular velocity keeps it from accelerating too quickly. Same for deceleration: if the motor decelerates, the prop's momentum makes it want to stay fast. It is only when the prop's position exceeds the motor's position, that the centrifugal force will slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you have to consider that the angular velocity is quite a lot - therefore the centrifugal force is very high and the prop will only slightly move in its mount, thus not really affecting the flight all that much. Especially, when you consider that most drones with foldable props (e.g. DJI Mavic series) are &quot;smart drones&quot;: They probably considered that during development and made it so that the motor speed is only raised and lowered slowly, so the effect isn't too noticeable. Plus, these drones are quite heavy so a tiny little change in prop speed will probably not have a big impact on the position in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see below, the propellers have different angles relative to the motor position. Obviously, propellers can only be designed for one direction of movement. Since the direction changes however, depending on whether it is accelerating or decelerating or at a constant speed, the uplift will be slightly reduced during speed changes of the props. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/L43di.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/L43di.png&quot; alt=&quot;motor acceleration and deceleration image&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="35" LastEditorUserId="35" LastEditDate="2020-05-08T15:47:42.650" LastActivityDate="2020-05-08T15:47:42.650" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This will cause a drop in efficency as the flight controller attempts to combat these vibrations and return to stable flight, using slightly more power in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excessive vibrations in parts of the frame caused by semi-flexible pieces and or unsecured electronics parts can also cause damage to the frame and electrical components and increases the risk of accidents where the quad falls apart prematurely or drops out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;More Details&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, any energy that goes into contorting the frame is energy that didn't go into accelerating/decelerating the quad, which is to say that bending the frame inflight will decrease the efficency of the whole system. This is also true about the thrust force vector, which will deviate slightly from vertical when the frame is bent, decreasing efficency. These losses would usually be very tiny and almost negligible because the amount of bending possible on most commercially available frames is miniscule. &lt;em&gt;If these kinds of losses are a problem on your quadcopter, you need to address them before you fly because they will likely cause your quad to fall out of the sky and or cause damage to itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are other issues with frames that allow parts to flex freely. Semi-rigid frames will move with the motor and propeller vibrations and bend when motor thrust changes, causing even more trouble for the flight controller and can impact flight performance. This can be another source of efficency loss as the flight controller tries to compensate for oscillations that are caused by parts of the frame vibrating uncontrollably. This is why it's always recommended to fully tighten screws and make sure all parts are carefully secured to the frame before flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditDate="2020-05-09T18:00:03.450" LastActivityDate="2020-05-09T18:00:03.450" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Each affects flight dynamics, and each is (somewhat) a function of material choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, titanium is very stiff, and it rings like a bell. CF is very stiff, but it rings like mud. Aluminum is in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Stiffness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stiffness is a good thing when you don't want your structure to be compliant[*]. Stiffness means that the frame isn't deflecting, which is important for the presumed laws of motion. Put another way, a quadcopter's autopilot assumes that all the motors are pointed in a fixed direction[**]. If those directions change, i.e. because of flexing, then the most fundamental assumptions of its flight dynamics are false. It's no surprise flight flight performance degrades!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, any structure will bend/deflect/twist under load, no matter how stiff. What's important is whether it does any of these sufficiently enough to compromise your flight goal. If you're trying to do telescopic videography then a little bit of error is immediately visible in the results. If you're learning to fly, then so long as the autopilot keeps things sunny-side up you're fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Oscillation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oscillation, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=120&amp;amp;v=f7tg94QflBY&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;control-surface flutter&lt;/a&gt;, occur when the  entire structure starts deforming like a spring. This can dramatically build up and quickly rip the airframe to shreds. (It really is that fast, that violent, and that scary.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a quad's arms are insufficiently damped, oscillations can occur. Most frequently, it will occur as a twist about the arm axis, but I've also seen it happen in the flapping direction. Because of differences in dynamics between a multirotor and a fixed-wing, it's unlikely that your quad will suffer inflight failure but it's also very hard to keep control, both for you and the autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closer you get to instability, the more energy you have to expend to keep things stable. In the case of a multi, at the very least this translates into decreased flight time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more powerful your input (e.g. a powerful quadcopter), the easier it is to drive a system past a critical damping threshold. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_destruction.ogv&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tacoma Narrows Bridge&lt;/a&gt; was famous for this when the wind  was blowing and the bridge was slightly wet. More recently, these out of control harmonic oscillations have famously been seen on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/11/051103080801.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Millennium Bridge in London&lt;/a&gt; (surprisingly due to human footfall) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digg.com/2020/holy-crap-look-at-how-much-this-suspension-bridge-in-china-moves-with-the-wind&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Humen Perl River Bridge in China&lt;/a&gt; (heavy winds).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A full discussion of how to control oscillation is outside the scope of this answer. However, it is relevant to note that some materials are springier than others, and these materials are the ones more likely to have pathological  oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Vibration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vibration is a form of oscillation, but I'm breaking it out so I can specifically address how it affects sensor data. Vibration is an issue when it causes signal integrity issues with the IMU (i.e. accelerometer + gyrometer)[***]. This can confuse the autopilot, leading it to make incorrect estimations of the aircraft's roll-pitch-yaw, and as a result respond inappropriately. This can and does cause crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, a full discussion of how to control vibration is outside the scope of this answer. And once again, the springier the material is, the more it is likely to have pathological vibration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Composites vs. metals&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Composites (e.g. carbon fiber, fiberglass, kevlar, ...) have what are called &lt;em&gt;anisotropic&lt;/em&gt; properties. This means that they don't have the same properties in all directions. Consider a square sheet of aluminum. No matter which axis you pull it on, it has the same strength, stiffness, heat transfer, etc... This is &lt;em&gt;isotropic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now consider the same sheet made out of unidirectional carbon fiber. Along the carbon fiber axis it's &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; strong. But turned 90 degrees, where the only thing holding it together is the glue, you'll find that it has no strength whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You would be correct in assuming that this difference in properties extends to oscillation and vibration. The upshot is that composites can be tricky to chose because two seemingly similar structures (e.g. a tube) can have very different properties. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[*]&lt;/code&gt; Able to move and bend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/2CFckjfP-1E&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;like the Goshawk&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;code&gt;[**]&lt;/code&gt; See math in &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/323/46&quot;&gt;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/323/46&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;code&gt;[***]&lt;/code&gt; For example, aliasing and clipping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastEditorUserId="46" LastEditDate="2020-05-09T19:18:58.310" LastActivityDate="2020-05-09T19:18:58.310" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This results in quicker battery drain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 10% figure that you've heard isn't a hard line, but rather just a suggestion based on experience with miniquad hardware and its capabilities. This recommendation isn't just specific to racing; all quads would benefit from the efficency (&lt;em&gt;energy extraction from the battery&lt;/em&gt;) boost from rarely using the top XX% of the throttle range. However, this is often more important in racing scenareos where it is often necessary to make the most of the energy in the battery pack you're using because you've selected the smallest and lightest one possible and need as much energy as you can get to complete the course in record time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastActivityDate="2020-05-09T18:15:44.817" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A 3 degree AOA is pretty normal for cruise flight, so this motor is mounted so that it's pointed in the direction of movement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it were not pointing downward, then when you changed thrust it would have a tendency to momentarily sink/climb.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of pointing down is that it increases pitch down tendency (or decreases pitch up tendency) when power is applied.

It all comes down to stall recovery. If the CG is behind the aerodynamic center, then if the plane stalls the nose will simply not come down. The upshot is that you can never regain airspeed and you will enter into what's called a &lt;em&gt;deep stall&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;leaf stall&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One common reason for cargo aircraft crashes is improperly secured loads which shift backwards immediately after rotation on takeoff. This moves the CG aft, and the plane can no longer keep its nose down and very quickly stalls unrecoverably. There is a famous video a decade years back of a US military cargo jet which had its cargo load shift back on takeoff while departing a Middle East airbase. All aboard died, and I won't post the link out of sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Excessive forward CG&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's too far forward then your elevator will have to produce a ton of downward force to keep the nose up. This is draggy and inefficient. But it's also (within the limits of reason) survivable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;So where to put the CG?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far back as you safely can! Competition glider pilots move the CG to the very limits of safety because they want to stop the elevator from producing downward thrust which costs precious meters of altitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jetliners want an aft CG because it saves fuel. But don't panic, they have strict limits on how far back they can move it. Because in equal parts no pilot wants to die and no amount of saved jet fuel ever covers the cost of a crashed plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:30.297" LastActivityDate="2020-05-14T12:20:48.563" CommentCount="8" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A good rule of thumb I've heard commonly thrown around is that if your motors are &lt;em&gt;SO&lt;/em&gt; hot to the touch that you want to take your fingers off after a few seconds, then that's too hot. If you feel like you could keep them there forever, then it's probably not something that will ever be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Physical Causes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that you have a mechanical connection issue somewhere on your drone which is causing problems, like if one of the motor fastener screws is protruding into the motor casing and making contact with the windings like in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo2sjTNS0pc&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this video from Joshua Bardwell&lt;/a&gt; which also goes through troubleshooting steps and how to rectify the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other physical causes can include locations on the drone where parts or wires (&lt;em&gt;like motor phase wires&lt;/em&gt;) that are touching conductive things they shouldn't be. Giving your drone a look over to make sure any of these aren't the problem is worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure that the hot motor is still balanced. If the motor has been damaged, that is almost certainly the cause of the elevated temperature of the motor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Filtering Issues&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ever went into the configurator for your flight controller firmware (&lt;em&gt;e.g. Betaflight, Cleanflight, Raceflight, iNav, etc.&lt;/em&gt;) and disabled or restricted the default gyroscope filtering settings, it's possible that these are the culprits. Insufficient filtering on the noisy gyroscope signals can result in hot motors because the flight controller tries to respond to the noise it sees in the gyroscope data and not just the pilot's inputs. The inconsistent nature of the gyro noise means that motor commands would be constantly changing up and down, which can be a cause of hot motors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ever tweaked the filtering settings to try and improve their latency, it's possible that any crashes you've since experienced have beat up the drone sufficiently that there is now extra noise that wasn't there before when you adjusted the filters, causing hot motors. In that case, I'd recommend raising the filter sensitivity. The Betaflight Configurator for &gt;4.0 versions of Betaflight makes this super easy with a slider that you could push towards increased filtering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;PID Tuning Factors&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As noted in this (&lt;em&gt;admittedly old, for Betaflight &amp;lt;2.x&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki/PID-Tuning-Guide&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Betaflight Tuning Guide&lt;/a&gt;, motors will start getting hot if your D-gains are too high. I would recommend checking all of the previous situations before pursuing this case because issues with the PID gains are often more subtle and difficult to track down, but a solution here would be to slowly back off on the D-gains in your PID controller until the motors cool down sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The D term in the PID controller tries to look ahead into the future and consider if the controller is trying to reach the pilot's input commands quickly enough, attempting to slow the reaction time or speed it up as necessary to minimize overshoot. This system can be completely screwed up if excess noise enters, so checking the filtering settings to make sure nothing is wrong there first is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastActivityDate="2020-05-12T16:38:27.980" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Normally, the motor arms are equally sized so that all motors have equal control authority and all contribute equally to providing thrust while in level flight when the C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is close to the center of the multirotor. Another way to say this is that multirotor frames are constructed so that the C&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;em&gt;center of lift/thrust&lt;/em&gt;) are all as close as possible to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/klpcI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/klpcI.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this is no longer the case because now each of the motors now has a slightly different lever arm distance to the C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; of the multirotor. Consequently, not all of the motors have the same control authority and some of the motors will have to remain at higher/lower throttle than others while in level flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will manifest itself in diminished flight performance. If all motors are running at the same throttle, the multirotor will naturally begin rotating with the longer lever arm(s) going upward and the shorter one(s) going down. If the distance between the C&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; isn't too great so as to not make the multirotor immediately flip over after raising the throttle, the I term in the PID controller of your flight controller should be able to account for the discrepancy after takeoff. The ability to pitch/roll in different directions will be different due to the asymmetric thrust distribution around the C&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even so, it isn't ever recommended to fly with a significant distance between the C&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is the number of cells, which directly impacts the voltage output of the battery. Just to be clear, I am specifically talking about LiPo batteries here as nominal voltages vary between battery chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each cell will add a maximum voltage of 4.2V, and a nominal voltage of 3.7V to the battery, so to figure out the nominal voltage of a battery, just multiply the number of cells by 3.7, so a 3S battery has a nominal voltage of 11.1V and a maximum voltage of 12.6V. This is very important using a battery with too low an S rating will likely make the aircraft more sluggish, but using a battery with too many cells is likely to make the aircraft more on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may see batteries written in the format 4S1P or similar. This means that there are 4 cells in series that are treated as one parallel cell - i.e that there are no other parallel cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Capacity&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The capacity of a battery is measured in mAh, or milli Amp-hours. This is the number of milliamperes the battery can output at the nominal voltage if the battery is discharged over the course of one hour. For example, a 1300mAh 4S battery could output 1.3A at 14.8V for one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, a greater capacity will mean more flight time, however there are caveats, an important one being the battery’s weight (which I will talk about later).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;C Rating&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The C rating is the maximum discharge rating, and it acts as a multiplier of the capacity. For example, if I have a 1300mAh LiPo with a C rating of 100, the maximum current output will theoretically be 100*1.3=130A. Obviously, a higher theoretical discharge rate should give greater performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These metrics are very variable between brands, however. What Turnigy considers to be 100C may only be 75C for another brand, so there is in reality very little point comparing C ratings between brands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C is also used when charging. You may have heard people say ‘charge at 1C’ or something similar, and this means the same thing. For example, charging a 1300mAh LiPo at 1C would be charging at 1.3A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Connector Type&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way you get the power from your quad is also very important. There are many connectors currently in use, but here is a rundown of the most common used on a multicopter:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JST PH2.0&lt;/strong&gt;: small white connectors most often used on Tiny Whoops, sometimes used in series on a toothpick.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BT2.0&lt;/strong&gt;: small white connectors most often used on Tiny Whoops, sometimes used in series on a toothpick.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XT30&lt;/strong&gt;: small yellow connectors, most often used on toothpicks and 2/3 inch quads.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XT60&lt;/strong&gt;: medium-sized yellow connectors, pretty much the standard for 4-7 inch quads.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XT90&lt;/strong&gt;: large yellow connectors, often used in parallel or series on larger Beast Class or X Class builds&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deans&lt;/strong&gt;: not commonly used in multicopters, however many batteries you will see do have this style of connector, which often has burgundy plastic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Weight&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, more capacity usually brings more weight, which introduces the problem of balancing capacity and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a toothpick with a 5000mAh should be able to fly for an hour, but would in reality be unlikely to last a minute if it could even take off due to the large weight of the battery. Some people say that your battery should not make up more than a third of the weight of your drone, however, you can huddle this based on your motors’ thrust and your build’s weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many factors when choosing what battery to use for your drone, however, all of the above aspects are vital in ensuring good performance and longevity of your aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="50" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2020-06-18T08:37:30.297" LastActivityDate="2020-05-14T12:32:20.000" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The aerodynamic center is the idealized point where all the drag forces are acting around it evenly. In other words, it can be thought of as the spot where half the drag rotates the quadcopter into a pitch up orientation, and half rotates it into a pitch down orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the relevant image.

This ensures positional stability, because as the drone is pushed backwards it naturally leans forward which reduces the speed at which it accelerates backwards. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, since the CG is above the aerodynamic center, when flying forward the drone wants to trip over its AC and pitch even more forward. This means that forward velocity is somewhat underdamped, results in a less positive-- or even negative-- feedback cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom-heavy CG: decreases position stability, increases velocity stability&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the CG is below the aerodynamic center. When there's a sudden gust which destabilizes the drone, the drone tilts away from its holding position, which combined with the gust's force, accentuates the positional error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But on the other when flying steadily forward the drone tends to want to pitch back toward the vertical, instead of tripping over its own feet. This means that forward velocity is well damped without a positive feedback cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[*] Roll functions exactly the same way, but it's distracting to write &quot;pitch/roll&quot; each time we're talking about a rotation.&#xA;[**] This is a basic tenet of aerodynamics and fluid flow, which is that it's indistinguishable if the object is moving through the fluid or the fluid is moving around the object.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46" LastEditorUserId="46" LastEditDate="2020-05-16T15:34:31.620" LastActivityDate="2020-05-16T15:34:31.620" CommentCount="4" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is because what the insurer is doing is taking the premiums and lending them out, much like a bank. So when you spend \$100/yr across 10 years, and you get back a $1000 payout in the tenth year, the entire time the insurance company has been earning interest on the money you gave them. This 5-10% overhead is quite profitable when you have tens and hundreds of billions of dollars stockpiled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The upshot is that insurance won't save you any money in the long-term, it only spreads the financial pressure of a decision across time. I only consider insurance worthwhile when the cost of throwing my hands up and walking away is unacceptably high. Put another way, I only get insurance when either required by contract or law (e.g. renters insurance or auto insurance), or when I cannot afford the consequences of not having the thing which is insured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worthwhile&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a pet, and I don't want to have a financial consideration enter into whether life-saving surgery is an option.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not worthwhile&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a television which I don't really watch and wouldn't miss it if it weren't there anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You'll have to decide for yourself the impact of losing your drone. If it's just a toy and you don't think you'll fly it again if you lose it, then maybe it's not worth the cost of insurance. If it's your livelihood and you can't afford to buy another one then insurance is a guarantee against catastrophic business failure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or if the amount of damage you could do with your drone could cause you to be personally liable for a ruinous amount, then you might want to protect yourself with insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

The potential medical or legal fees can be huge, so having protection against this is worthwhile. Some model aircraft organisations offer third-part insurance as part of their membership benefits - for example the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmfa.org/Info/Articles/Know-your-insurance&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;BMFA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However, your risk estimation will also consider &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you are flying - a &amp;lt;250g toy is unlikely to cause major damage or injury compared to a 20kg scale model aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you first-party insure depends on your own personal financial situation - and the importance you place on your aircraft.

For this reason, the general rule of thumb for racing 5&quot; quadcopters is that the point beyond which 38k RPM would be met is excessive, and unlikely to contribute meaningful thrust beyond that point.  Since carrying a large enough battery to provide extra power is usually a significant weight offset (greater than 5% craft weight to jump up to the next highest capacity within the same battery voltage and discharge lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is less obvious, but very relevant for racers - resolution on the sticks.  By properly limiting throttle output, it is possible to create better resolution on the control gimbal by having the full stick travel focus on a narrower section of the available throttle power.  Correctly is important here, you don't want to limit throttle in a way that converts the top N% of stick travel into a dead zone.&#xA;For me personally, I run a 94-96% limit at the transmitter, even when I want full throttle, because at these input throttle levels, at least one motor will be at 100% because of the PID loop compensating for some attitude adjustment while flying, and the way that mixer works, I can't actually get more overall thrust out of that quadcopter because it has one motor already maxed out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, running 'excess' KV setups where, for example, you are leveraging the ability to run 2500KV batteries on 5S or 6S packs that you can take advantage of the higher voltage and efficiency of lower amperage draw in most flight regimes for running those batteries, you can limit the motor output (again, 38k RPM is a solid guideline here) you will want to limit the motor output at the flight controller (i.e. never ask the ESC for a throttle setting above a value at which the ESC or motor will hurt itself, desync, overdraw batteries, or turn the propeller into a audible goose-honk source), then you can work to add resolution to the sticks through that same method if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Resolution is the less obvious, but often more valuable reason to focus on this for racing applications, because having more stick travel range to make fine adjustments in will allow for more accurate corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="81" LastActivityDate="2020-05-13T15:48:42.680" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

When a drone has the ideal shape of ducted fan, it could decrease battery consumption by up to 60% &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; almost double the thrust. However, many drones that use ducted fans don't have a duct with optimal shape or have heavy ducts and thus won't get as significant advantages. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An optimal duct for hovering would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QKB6G.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QKB6G.png&quot; alt=&quot;duct&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, for larger quadcopters, creating a ducted fan with tight tolerances would probably add a lot of weight which would diminish the usefulness of the duct and if a duct is severely limiting the prop size, it can limit the quadcopter's efficiency because larger props tend to be more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another impact on performance that can be caused from using ducts, (especially for high performance or fast quadcopters), is ducts can cause the drone to react strangely when performing aerobatic maneuvers because the ducts can catch the wind and push the quadcopter off course. The ducts can also add more drag when the quadcopter moves fast. An open-blade quadcopter is generally smoother when performing fast movements or maneuvers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, If a drone has ducts with tight tolerances that don't add too much weight and has the &quot;optimal&quot; duct shape, it will probably be more efficient and get better flight time than a similar open-blade quadcopter but it may be less smooth and efficient when performing fast aerobatic maneuvers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source of information about efficiency: &lt;a href=&quot;https://capolight.wordpress.com/2015/01/14/quadcopter-rotor-duct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;The ideal shape for a multirotor ducted-fan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="170" LastEditorUserId="54" LastEditDate="2020-05-14T16:34:44.887" LastActivityDate="2020-05-14T16:34:44.887" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The springs on that side of the car compress and push harder on the wheels. The tyres push harder on the ground and the ground pushes back. The extra force from the ground exactly balances the extra weight and (after possibly bouncing for a moment) the car stops moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an unstable system, say a broom balanced vertically, once it moves from the perfect balance point gravity will pull it further away and it accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a quadcopter, there is no force that returns it to its original location, holding it horizontal, or even preventing a gradual roll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if the thrust from each motor was exactly the same, and the weight was perfectly balanced, it's very unlikely to be perfectly stationary. If there's even the slight amount of pitch or roll, the angle from horizontal will gradually increase. As the angle increases, the sideways thrust increases and the drone accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the roll rate is constant, the angle and acceleration increase linearly, the horizontal speed increases faster as the acceleration builds, and the distance from the starting position increases even faster as the speed builds. To the pilot, it looks like the drone is accelerating away from its original position much like the broom falling over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To a systems engineer, the rotation of the drone is neutrally stable - there are no forces increasing or decreasing the rotation rate. However the speed and position are unstable - once it starts moving, it accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should mention that there are second-order (i.e. relatively minor) forces too. If you had a large fin on top of the drone, aerodynamic drag on the fin would return the drone to upright as the speed builds and limit the maximum speed - in practice this isn't useful as it doesn't return the drone to its original position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastEditorUserId="299" LastEditDate="2020-05-18T17:29:38.273" LastActivityDate="2020-05-18T17:29:38.273" CommentCount="6" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The best way to improve efficiency is to simply increase the propeller size, as this will be much more effective than adding winglets to the propellers. An explanation for why larger propellers are more efficient can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/961/why-are-larger-propellers-generally-more-efficient-than-smaller-ones&quot;&gt;Why are larger propellers generally more efficient than smaller ones?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But when space is limited, and you are stuck with small props, winglets are supposed to be able to help, but don't always help that much. It is a trade off between the winglets &quot;ability to reduce induced drag traded off against their added wetted area increasing the profile&#xA;drag.&quot; Profile drag is the drag caused by the shape of the wing section. You can read more about winglets &lt;a href=&quot;http://mandhsoaring.com/Why%20Winglets/WL-IT.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can work well is to have very slight winglets, or small curves on the end of the propeller blades like this:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwHA5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwHA5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Blended winglet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This creates some of the efficiency benefits of winglets without really increasing the profile drag. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, really the best option is to use larger propellers if you want maximum efficiency. Winglets, however, can also increase the overall efficiency of a propeller, but with some tradeoffs and they don't always improve efficiency much.

The exact amount varies quite widely depending on exactly how close the wing/rotor is to the ground. For a plane or helicopter it may only be 10% extra lift, but a vehicle designed to maximise ground effect (like a hovercraft) can fly with vastly less power than would be required to fly without ground effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ground effect is particularly noticeable if you hover a model helicopter inverted over a smooth surface. As it descends towards the floor, it looks as if it lands in a big soft cushion - decelerating and bobbing around at about half to a third of rotor diameter. You can hover without the constant adjustments in collective pitch that are normally required, and need to drastically reduce thrust to go lower. When you're half an inch or less off the floor, it's probably only using 10-20% of the pitch required for normal hovering, and there's a self-levelling effect so it's much easier than it looks!&#xA;For a typical FPV quadcopter with 5&quot; props on top of the motors, you almost can't feel ground effect if you put the battery under the frame. With the battery on top you can feel a noticeable cushion and you can find a throttle setting that holds the quad off the ground but won't climb out of ground effect. I'd estimate that it's flying at about 80-90% of normal power. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the power may be reduced, it can be harder to hold a multi-rotor or helicopter in place when in ground effect. The bubble of higher pressure tries to escape out from underneath the aircraft, pushing it in the opposite direction.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A general rule of thumb is that the reduction in power due to ground effect starts to be noticeable when the altitude is less than around half or a third of the wing span or rotor diameter. The 'air bubble' effect on position holding while hovering is noticeable one or two diameters above the ground. Both tail off gradually so there's no hard limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/311/what-is-ground-effect&quot;&gt;What is ground effect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/43026/how-high-does-the-ground-effect-last&quot;&gt;How high does the ground effect last?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;* &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/70731/does-ground-effect-scale-11-with-wingpsan&quot;&gt;Does ground effect scale 1:1 with wingspan?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and lots more, over at the Aviation stack-exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also this excellent academic paper:&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2017/1823056/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Characterization of the Aerodynamic Ground Effect and Its Influence in Multirotor Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastEditorUserId="124" LastEditDate="2020-05-26T09:02:57.873" LastActivityDate="2020-05-26T09:02:57.873" CommentCount="8" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The configuration is similar to the Dornier Do335:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J97rM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/J97rM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dornier Do335&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you can get quite close to double. But look at the distance between the props. That's at least 5 times prop width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also tried building a coaxial two motor EDF unit. The result was I got at best around 106% thrust - that's right, the second motor takes twice the power but only adds 6% of additional thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also tried coaxial configurations outside of a ducted system and got around 120% thrust. So a second motor takes twice the power but added 20% thrust. This was OK because at the time I was depending on the coaxial rotation to counter torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is all anecdotal from my personal experience. So I wanted to find any research on this and it turns out that someone at Rutgers University have already done the experiments: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/55491/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/55491/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll quote the relevant conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With a pitch of 4.4 inches, contrarotating second, third, and fourth rotors &#xA;   roduced 71%, 53%, and 41% of the first rotor’s thrust, respectively. With a pitch of 4.4 inches, co-rotating second, third, and fourth rotors produced 61%, 42%, and 40% of the first rotor’s thrust, respectively. This confirmed that contra-rotating coaxial rotors generate more thrust than co-rotating coaxial rotors by effectively recovering the energy put into the swirl of the leading propeller’s wake. With a pitch of 10 inches, co-rotating second, third, and fourth rotors produced &lt;strong&gt;97%&lt;/strong&gt;, 67%, and 54% of the first rotor’s thrust, respectively. This demonstrated that downstream propellers are capable of generating more thrust when operating at higher pitches. The thrust losses of the downstream propellers do not have to be as high as they typically are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that they managed to get almost double the thrust of a single propeller: 197%. But for this to work the second propeller had to have a much higher pitch than the first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But do note that in the section of the report about thrust measurements (page 46) the author cautiously noted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although a multirotor system could benefit greatly from a coaxial arrangements, some can be an exercise in futility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to know if your idea would work I'd suggest building a test jig and measure the thrust.

On the other hand, when a propeller is spinning at higher speed, a flexible propeller will have a tendency to flex upward and flatten out vs a stiff propeller that is designed to resist flexing (stiff propellers will still flex, but not as much as a flexible propeller).  With a flexible propeller, this could result in a scenario where you have more throttle to give, but the drone won't go any faster.  To some degree, you might also notice that the drone is less controllable - might not take a corner as well as a stiff propeller would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have a lower powered motor, a flexible (lighter) propeller might be your best option because you may never reach the point where efficiency is an issue.

If there's, for example, a house or other large object in the vicinity of the path between the transmitter and receiver, the 1 MHz signal with a wavelength of 300 m will find it a lot easier to avoid being disturbed and reflected than the 100 MHz signal with a wavelength of 3 m for the simple reason that it is just so much larger in comparison to the house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At extremely long ranges (&lt;em&gt;like over the horizon&lt;/em&gt;), other effects also come into play like the ability of lower frequency signals to more easily reflect off the curved surface of the earth and the ionosphere, but these kinds of transmission distances aren't an issue for RC aviation for more practical reasons. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2.4 GHz RC solutions are far more ubiquitous because the antennae required to transmit and receive signals at a frequency of 2.4 GHz are far smaller than those required for 900 MHz.

So you can send commands via the serial protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would be a very simple way to send commands to the flight control but the downside is that you need to build your own radio receiver or find a way to send commands to the receiver directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another simple option would be the MSP protocol that is used by a number of different open source projects. It is another serial interface but with this protocol you can read and write information from/to the flight control.

The torque is directly proportional to the rate of change of RPMs, which is directly proportional (though non-linear) to thrust. How quickly the motor-prop combination can make adjustments has a massive impact on overall stability. That may or may not be necessary depending on how agile you need your swarm to be, but in larger applications where stability and agility are key, it's a very important factor to know when optimizing power systems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, measuring torque directly may not be specifically necessary if you have high enough resolution in the rest of your data. When I was setting up the test equipment for Mini Quad Test Bench, I abandoned the complexity of multiple load cells in favor of higher resolution RPM, voltage, and current data. By measuring those values at a very fast rate, I can detect the rate of change directly which is actually the more critical information than simply the torque number. I also found consistency problems with using linear motion of any kind and ended up mounting the prop vertically on a steel arm above the load cell with no mechanical interlinking. I've been able to achieve extremely repeatable results with essentially zero drift. My calibration numbers haven't changed in years of heavy testing, and we were able to replicate the stand and match the data at a second location. Unfortunately the inexpensive load cell amplifiers I'm using aren't capable of more than about 4ms read rates, so that data lags behind the rest of my data. If you get a more expensive amplifier though, you can up the resolution of that data as well, and really get a good picture. This is where the RCBenchMark setup falls down. I got one, but ended up not using it, as the data was simply too low resolution to be useful for what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information on our setup, and the steps we went through to get there you can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miniquadtestbench.com/equipment/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;equipment page over at MQTB&lt;/a&gt;.

The designer of a propeller can influence the tip losses, but a user is unlikely to find a practical way to accomplish it for a propeller they already own. So this question is theoretical.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The overall size and geometry of a propeller can influence the tip losses, but for any particular multirotor, the size or length of the propeller is most likely to be at its maximum size already. Or, if it is not at the maximum size, the length of the propeller is at the optimum size for the multirotor it is installed on. Making the propellers any longer than the airframe can accommodate makes the question morph to one of: &quot;What changes to a multirotor influence the tip losses of the propeller.&quot; Ok, now the answer can include making the prop longer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, the answer is: &quot;Buy a better propeller&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the theoretical world, redesign the propeller. And one could also add a well designed shroud with a very precise gap (very narrow) between the tip of the propeller and the shroud. And to accomplish this, the tip of the propeller would then need to have a shape that is different than one designed for free air. It would fit precisely with the shroud just a fraction of a millimeter away. This prevents the tip vortexes from rolling off the end of the propeller. But if this theory were practical for multirotors, one or more drone maker would have employed it already. And so far, it is not being done. I have not yet seen it. They are also claimed to be quieter and more efficent, but that too is not proven with any experimental evidence on an entire drone. It is all laboratory results. So there must be trade-offs that make that solution unattractive.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to actually add a shroud, we are back to changing the entire multirotor to reduce the tip losses. I am not sure that is what the question was.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most prop manufacturers make claims that their props are better, but provide little proof or clues regarding how they did it. We can see unique shapes used on the tips, but there is little published data that helps us replicate it for ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Was this question one of theory or a practice?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="513" LastActivityDate="2020-05-28T20:28:40.443" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The primary thing is that it is not in-air current draw that typically kills the ESCs in multi-rotors. Static load measurements gained through testing at full throttle on the bench are only reflective of worst-case (or almost) scenarios in flight. When a multi-rotor is flying forward the current draw dissipates very quickly thanks the to lower angle of attack, which dramatically reduces current draw. The only time you will see close to or greater than static load is for very short times when the motors are at high throttle but the movement is either zero or negative to the direction of thrust, those situations don't typically last very long, and your battery can't sustain that level of current delivery for long before sagging out reducing the current output. Essentially, as soon as the movement begins to follow the direction of thrust the, the effective angle of attack decreases and the current draw starts dropping immediately.  Due to this static thrust numbers can be considered as 2-3 seconds of burst at the maximum. Combine that with the fact that most batteries we use in mini-quads won't be able to deliver over about 80A for more than 10 seconds or so, and you realize quickly that sustained draw is not an issue, and even a 20A ESC would be sufficient if we were only looking at in-flight sustained current requirements.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real killer of ESCs comes in two varieties. The first is damage from repetitive large spikes that happen when the ESC rapidly changes the throttle output to the motor. On significant and rapid throttle changes, the moment when the duty cycle of the FETs has changed but physical acceleration in the motor has yet to begin massive amounts of current are dumped into the coils. This dissipates very quickly as soon as the motor begins accelerating, but spikes close to 180A for upwards of 2-3 ms are typical in most mini-quad motors. Spikes will be even larger with physically larger motors and higher torque load. Some of this depends on the Kv and resulting Kt of the motor and how much if a torque load the given prop mass and pitch creates, but the spikes are huge compared to what we see in sustained draw. While these spikes don't necessarily fry a motor instantly in the air, they do cause wear on the FETs, and if an ESC is pushed like this over long periods of time, this can end up leading to catastrophic failure in the FETs. If pushed hard enough, it can blow a FET on rapid throttle changes outright, but you would have to have a pretty under-specced ESC or dramatically overloaded motor for it to happen instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second issue has to do with the stall torque of the motor. When a motor is blocked while trying to spin it will pretty much instantly hit the stall torque current which can be huge. It is typically high enough that it will blow an ESC or burn the resin costing off the windings in a matter of seconds, sometimes less. This is probably one of the primary causes for failure in mini-quad and racing drones, right after physical damage to the components. (We crash a lot at very high speeds )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a bit more detail in a similar answer here ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/466/effect-of-motor-load-on-esc/724#724&quot;&gt;Effect of motor load on ESC?&lt;/a&gt; ) along with some charts from data I've collected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what's the takeaway here? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the higher rates ESC also happen to have FETs and supporting circuitry that can handle higher pulsed current (those millisecond peaks) and higher short bursts ratings that make it more likely they will survive abuse over time. You need to look at your required use case for the ESC. If it is being used for an application where accleration will be minimal and there is not much risk of crashing or blocked props, then you can probably get away with very minimally rated ESCs. If you plan on crashing or otherwise abusing your motors, the higher the rating the more likely they will be to survive situations that would blow lower rated ESCs. This is the real reason you see folks pushing 55A and 60A rates ESCs (though to be honest those ratings are probably dramatically inflated). If you have real questions about the specific application, you can always find the datasheet for the FETs being used in the ESCs in question and look at the pulsed current rating, thermal dissipation limits, and suggested maximum sustained current draw and make a decision from that, but generally speaking the states rating is sufficient in most cases, assuming sufficient quality control on the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastEditorUserId="169" LastEditDate="2020-06-06T20:51:37.797" LastActivityDate="2020-06-06T20:51:37.797" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This has all the characteristic advantages and drawbacks of open source: On the plus side, it's highly customizable and extendable, often has the most cutting edge tech, open standards, portability of code, etc. Most importantly for this application, it allows interoperability with about any kind of peripheral you can think of (provided that this peripheral can talk via one of the standard protocols, e.g. SPI/I²C/RS232/OneWire/etc, though you probably could hack in support for proprietary protocols as well if you really wanted). All of that is balanced by around zero customer support: No one's there to hold your hand, and any issues you might experience you'll have to troubleshoot on your own, maybe with the help of knowledgeable friends... or internet strangers like ourselves. Given that you're already a software engineer, you're probably doing it all the time anyway, however.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Second: There's only a few scriptable autopilots.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to cover the open source ones for the most part, as for the reasons outlined above I was never particularly interested in the proprietary variety. Also, I'm talking about high-level flight code, e.g. code that defines complex behavior &lt;em&gt;on top of some other flight control software, which in turn provides at least basic stabilization and primitive maneuvering&lt;/em&gt;. If you want to dabble in low-level stabilization code that works directly with bare metal, you can just fork any flight control project or even write your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, a rundown of all the options in order of increasing complexity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most flight control software has varying degrees of inbuilt flight behavior automation such as takeoff, landing, position hold/loiter, return to home, and waypoint missions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The latter represents the most basic form of programming: you set up a flight route consisting of waypoints, possibly with other modes thrown in (e.g. takeoff, go to waypoint A, then B, loiter there for 10 minutes, go home, land). This &lt;em&gt;mission&lt;/em&gt; is then uploaded to the drone and off it goes. This, as far as I know, does not support conditionals or other control structures, so is not turing-complete.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more complex high-level flight control, there's a widely-supported protocol called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mavlink.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MAVLink&lt;/a&gt;. It allows for a device external to the flight controller to query flight parameters and issue commands via a UART connection. This is the protocol that's usually used by ground station software (through which you define the waypoint missions mentioned above and otherwise remotely control your craft's behavior). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MAVLink is supported by most flight control software suites, and is very bulletproof by the standards of this currently highly experimental field. The data and commands available via the protocol range from the highest inbuilt abstraction level (e.g. add waypoints or change flight modes and set their parameters) to almost the lowest (e.g. query exact attitude, read data from gyros or other peripherals, set rotation rates), and the set can be extended arbitrarily. The only caveat is that it's only a communication protocol/API, so you'll need some kind of external computing device, either onboard or remote, to provide the actual logic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;physically external logic&quot; approach is probably the most approachable option for a regular programmer, since you can run your flight code on your laptop in any language you like, controlling the craft remotely via a telemetry link (which is basically a pair of transponders, one of which plugs into USB and the other into the flight controller's UART, providing a bidirectional serial connection over radio). If you do so, mind the latency and link health: it might restrict you to higher-level control. If you find yourself needing more fine-grained control, you can move the code to an onboard computer (e.g. raspberry pi) connected to the flight controller directly, getting rid of the radio link and retaining the familiar Unix-y operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MSP protocol mentioned in the other reply falls, as far as I can tell, into the same category, but is somewhat more specific. That's perfectly fine, though; use whatever works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's the option of &lt;em&gt;onboard scripting&lt;/em&gt;, defined as user code that runs on the flight controller hardware together with (or, rather, &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt;) the basic flight control software itself, and makes use of the latter's capabilities. This allows one to code custom flight logic without modifying the code of the autopilot itself, yet have both high-level control of the autopilot's automation features, and fine-grained low-level access to the craft's hardware with about the lowest possible latency. The approach comes with some operating restrictions, however, since you'll have to work within a real-time operating environment and with very limited resources. Also, there's only a small selection of autopilots which support such scripting, at least ones that I know of, and all of those are thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/688&quot;&gt;a question&lt;/a&gt; I asked earlier on this very site. Here's a summary of the contents:&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ardupilot &lt;a href=&quot;https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-lua-scripts.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;supports onboard Lua scripting&lt;/a&gt; in its Copter/Rover variants since v4.0 and in Plane since v3.11. As of right now, this seems the most &quot;lightweight-yet-powerful&quot; option and thus most promising for my use case.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rosflight.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ROSflight&lt;/a&gt; has been suggested, which is an autopilot package running on top of the Robot Operating System, all of which is apparently highly modular and allows you to add (or replace) any part of the flight code independently. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/a/895/272&quot;&gt;relevant answer&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, this comment by &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/users/46/kenn-sebesta&quot;&gt;Kenn Sebesta&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Tau Labs supports picoC and full flight scripting. It is very stable and the feature set is robust, but it's a bit abandonware at this point so you'd be on your own for support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There might be more I don't know of, so may want to look around some more if you want onboard scripting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Third: Your hardware choice will depend heavily on which of the above you choose.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first (implicit) choice is the type of platform: plane, multicopter, boat, car, etc. Of which you seem to have already chosen the second, but I'm going to point out the existence of that choice anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then comes the flight control system's architecture as outlined above: Is it going to be just a single (scriptable) flight controller? An FC with a control link to a ground station? An FC/onboard general-purpose single board computer pairing? Something else? If you've got a specific application in mind, do you need any particular onboard peripherals/payload that need to be integrated into the control stack? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all of that in mind, you'll choose a combination of flight controller (hardware) and flight control package (firmware), plus possibly the aforementioned peripherals, secondary computer, radio links for the ground station, etc., and then an airframe that will carry your hardware and payload comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's possible you'll find an integrated package with all of that included that will fit your needs, either proprietary or open source hardware. Of the former, the Tello might be one. Of the latter, I know of &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/ardubee-a-ready-to-fly-micro-drone-for-education-and-swarming/54362&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ArduBee&lt;/a&gt;, a single-board copter (in which the PCB &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the drone's frame) built for ArduPilot, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://outcastdroneworks.com/products/microhawk-complete-maker-kit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MicroHawk&lt;/a&gt;, which is purpose-built to fit a Raspberry Pi Zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Finally: You'll need to learn to fly the thing manually. No excuses.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, accidents with UAVs happen. Software bugs or other malfunctions that are &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of leading to an accident are even more common. Especially when it's your own prototype code. It's not a question of &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;. And just losing the aircraft is one of the better outcomes. A multicopter is inherently dangerous. It's a flying blender with sharp blades connected to a half-kilo brick, which is often traveling at 50+ km/h. You &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want it to fly into anything that you care about. So unless you're only going to fly in a very unpopulated area and run a hundred meters away from the thing before each launch, you must at least learn the basics of flying a drone, in both stabilized (attitude) and acro (rate) modes, to the point of being confident enough in your abilities to assume manual control at any moment if the aircraft starts to act in a way it's not supposed to, and guide it safely to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides, manual piloting of both quadcopters and fixed-wing planes is fun! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask for any clarification or additional details I might have missed, and I'll add it to the answer (or as a comment).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="272" LastEditorUserId="272" LastEditDate="2020-06-07T01:05:38.663" LastActivityDate="2020-06-07T01:05:38.663" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

These guys are top notch and know their specific field of speciality, however there is an important nuance which needs to be understood work respect to his answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I posited the question from a slightly different perspective, however I would be highly confident that this answer would apply to your question. I emailed and asked an FAA Safety Team employee (as opposed to one of the hard to differentiate FAA Safety Team Volunteers) that if the FAA chooses to levy enforcement action(s) upon an FAA Private, Commercial, or ATP certified pilot as a result of this pilot committing a violation of a defined FAA regulation while the pilot was operating under 14CFR  Part 91, could the enforcement action be extended to other FAA issued certificates held by the pilot such as a 14CFR Part 145 Airframe &amp;amp; Powerplant (A&amp;amp;P) Aircraft Mechanic Certificate or a 14CFR Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having held some form of FAA certification for over well over 3 decades, was certain I know what the answer would be, because I had heard it time and time again. And the FAA Safety Team employee responded with exactly what I thought, absolutely. But like I stated before, this &quot;absolutely&quot; carries with it a number of very important caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, while I appreciated the response, the response is consistent with all previous answers received when the question has been answered, the truth is that individual's answer to me is just barely better than conjecture. How could that be, he's a no kidding, Federal Paycheck receiving FAA Civil Servant employee, how in the hell could I suggest that his answer was anything but The FAA's version of divine intervention?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because his job title sounds like the right guy, but he's not the got who would be making the decision, it had likely ever made that type of decision. The FAA Safety Team managers are primarily tasked with spreading the good word, about safety. They coordinate all the Safety Seminars, they can be asked to provide recurrent training to those who have been violated, but that's them doing a favor for a colleague, the colleague who actually wields the stick of enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those individuals are called FAA Safety Inspectors. They are the highest authority, above all the Designated Inspectors, when it comes to taking a practical flight exam. If you're a drone pilot and you're unsure if that tell, here's an opinion most won't like to hear. For every single pilot certification, applicants are required to show a 70+ on a proctored 60 - 100 question written exam (should sound familiar). But then, they are required to sit across from either a Designated Examiner or FAA Safety Inspector at a table and answer up to 3 hours worth of direct verbal worsening (called the oral exam, but that's a bit salacious to use), and then followed by what's called the Practical Exam. Based on what specific pilot certification, rating, or type certificate being sought, the practical exam Soraya takes place in the air flying an aircraft the applicant is familiar with and usually lasts over an hour performing a series of requisite manuevers which must be demonstrated within a defined set of standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These FAA Safety Inspectors are a group of FAA employees who are in no way affiliated with the FAA Safety Team managers, falling under a completely separate division, or what the FAA colloquially calls a separate &quot;Line of Business&quot;, or LOB. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been told my entire career that even my A&amp;amp;P could legally, and in some cases would be suspended for serious enough violations being enforced upon a completely unrelated certificate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the second caveat is FARRR now important to fully understand when you are pondering such things. The FAA always has been, always will be, and will do everything in it's power to try and indoctrinate the new sUAS crowd, run as a self regulating, honor based system of checks and balances, who will do nearly everything in their power to avoid resorting to issuing violations of certificated pilots. This may seem hard to believe, but trust me, I've been here a while. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, in my opinion, it takes a pretty special kind of violation of regulations to result in forcing their hand, and even then they will put an emphasis on retraining in lieu of suspensions or revocations of a certificate. There are a few sure ways that they have absolutely no choice, at least from where I stand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1st, Any violation of the DC-SFRA or Presidential TFR, even popup, they literally have no choice but to suspend your certificate, but also recognize that they will also be advocating on your behalf to the US Secret Service who can get a little trigger happy with the criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2nd, Any obvious and willful violations of Class D, Class C, Class B, and/ or Class A airspace, without ATC clearance, and without offering any reasonable justification. This can also happen with repeated, obviously not getting it airspace violations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3rd, Your violation(s) caused a severe breakdown in the flight safety of your aircraft and any others in the vicinity. If your actions result in the injury of loss of life of other people, your certificates are going to be the last of your problems. I see this being the case the first time a drone operator is foolish enough to get their platform sucked into an engine intake. 22,000 RPM turbine vanes don't have a great record of resiliency in such events, something similar killed 3 people on a Southwest Airlines B-737 a year or so ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3rd, If you treat the FAA Safety Investigaters with a heavy dose of wanton disrespect because you're angry they are violating your, they will drop a bookshelf on you and just watch as you struggle to find your footing, and good on them. This bookshelf is of course figuratively speaking and meant to represent worse than getting the book thrown at you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal, if you're called by an Inspector to discuss some violation you may or may not have committed with a drone or manned aircraft, don't snap into the defensive posture and start to deny deny deny. These folks are absolutely here to figure out what happened, ensure you're aware of the regulations, ensure you're clear on what part of your operation was being investigated as the violation, and how to ensure it won't likely issue again on your watch. They have no desire to suspend or revoke anyone's certificates, because they are fully aware that as is often the case with named pilots, this is often the individual's means of making a living. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the answer is yes, any enforcement actions resulting from any in-flight regulatory violation of one certificate can have detrimental effects on all other certificates.  it could, but the caveat is unless you're really obtuse about or have no intentions of following anyone's roles or regulations&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about Party 107 Certificates are the numbers. This actually frustrates me for a number of reasons. Before the Party 107, I have always held at any given time, three separate FAA Pilot Certifications. My Commercial, my Flight Instructor, and my A&amp;amp;P Mechanic certification. Every single one of those really gave no relation to the others, the Instructor Cert being related to Commercial Pilot Cert, I'll concede, but nothing else. Despite these differences, every one of my FAA certificates were adorned with the same number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every single one, except now for my Party 107 Remote Operator Certificate. The rumor was back in the day that this was done many years ago to ensure investigators were aware of all certificates.

That said, if reduced noise is what you are looking for, and we remove the other parts of the drone from the equation, I'd suggest stiffer props from the manufacturer of your choice.  After flying for a while, if you feel that the noise level is getting worse, change props (all of them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, as long as the props are balanced (most manufacturers have gotten better and producing consistently balanced props), on the stiffer side, clean, and free of any kinks or abrasions, they will be as quiet as they can be.

Below this size, things don't really get any cheaper but it gets a lot harder to squeeze everything into the frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you need more space, the F450 'Flame wheel' frame is pretty standard for development drones. It's heavy and fragile compared to an 250 frame though, and everything is more expensive, so I'd stay small if you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Programmable' is difficult to define as almost no one writes their own code, yet the dividing line between 'toy' and 'hobby' grade is when the flight controller has a USB port and can be flashed with (usually) open-source firmware such as BetaFlight, and the PIDs and flight modes configured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most flight controllers only have a couple of inputs, one of which is used for the RC receiver. The other is for people who want to add a GPS (and some flight controllers have built in barometer and compass). In theory then, you could do everything with a standard flight controller, if you can work out how to modify BetaFlight, and you're careful to leave it enough CPU time to fly the drone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternately you could handle navigation on the ESP32 and just send the flight controller commands as if it was the RC receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step up are the flight controllers designed for autonomous flight, such as the Pixhawk. They have a lot more inputs and software for setting up waypoint missions. They are more expensive though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You probably don't need the button cell, most people use a PDB (power distribution board) to split the battery wires to the motors, and they usually also contain a 12v and 5v regulator, and often the flight controller also provides 3.3v&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you're unlikely to stay under 250g so you need to register as a drone operator with the CAA.

We fly mostly chase scenes with large vehicles, any failure is quite serious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of bad or old batteries is voltage swing.  If you black box or watch live voltage data on a puffed 4s (16.8v charged) you will see the voltage immediately drop to sub 8v on first punch.  That is too low, even for a second.  A good (100c+) 4s will never dip much below 12v on the same punch.  Sudden low voltage can upset the electronics and balance.  I have burnt up a number of VTX recently by dropping voltage too low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though puffed batteries produce less &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;, they still are dangerous and could ignite other batteries, so separate them (I carry 2 lip bags usually).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lipo is only good until it is not. As soon as it is not safe to fly assess the condition and take action immediately.  If not dead, but too lame to fly normal and safe I keep as a &amp;quot;scout battery&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;desk battery&amp;quot;.  A scout battery is my first battery to use where I simply hover and make sure all radio gear is good and see if any EM problems exist before full flight. Desk batteries I use for testing builds and buffering power supply.  So many batteries may go weak but still be safe for limited or testing use.  If you are not familiar with battery life cycles and detection of flaws please dump them correctly and immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally - I have had a person close to me loose the entire house by charging LiPo batteries unattended.  The threat is real and if this happens expect the insurance company to try and not pay claiming you &amp;quot;did not follow the instructions for safe use&amp;quot; and deny a claim.  That is what happened to our friend.

The Reynolds number is linear in length, which for the wing is the chord length. So for example, a quarter-scale model will have a Reynolds number equal to one-forth that of the full-scale aircraft (in the same atmospheric conditions). The reason this matters is that airflow tends to transition from laminar to turbulent at a specific Reynolds number, so if one uses the same airfoil on the model as in the full-scale aircraft, then usually the performance will be different near stall (usually much worse). That is why reduced-scale models usually change to an airfoil that is designed for lower Reynolds numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW, Intro to Aerodynamics by Anderson is excellent.

This lets you get a feel for the controls. Once you've got the basics, switch to a camera on the ground because the vital skill to learn is thinking of the control directions relative to the plane and not your view. The most common beginner mistake is to steer the wrong way when the plane is flying towards them, so practice this until steering the right way feels natural to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your first challenge is just keeping the plane in the air and within sight. If you find this hard, pick a large, high-wing trainer plane, and reduce the simulation speed. Many sims have a 'zoom' function that helps when the plane is far away. Don't get too used to artificial aids like this though, turn them off as soon as you can manage without them because they won't be there in real life!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then learn to land. Learn where the plane needs to be to glide in to the runway, and when to pull the nose up (flare) to touch down gently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you can land, turn on some wind to make it more realistic. Try a wide range of models to learn their differences. Practice flying an out-of-trim model because almost all models will be out of trim on their first flight, and you can even turn up the simulation speed to simulate how nervous you will be on your first real flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you can do that, I suggest downloading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://achievements.bmfa.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;BMFA's achievement scheme notes&lt;/a&gt; (look in the Downloads menu) or similar for another country.

Free simulators are perfectly adequate for learning to fly but the extra graphics quality, models and game modes are more likely to keep you coming back to a commercial sim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also suggest buying a small toy quadcopter/drone that can be flown indoors.

This is only a problem if you want more controls such as rudder, elevator, elevons, etc but if you only want to control pitch you will have enough channels. Another thing to consider is that the electronics in rc cars are usually a lot  heavier that those in drones/planes. This is especially the case with ESCs as rc car ESCs will have heat-sinks and sometimes fans built in. If the ESC that you have is too heavy you can get around this by replacing it with a cheap, lightweight ESC (with an adequate BEC to power the servo) that has no heat-sink/fan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few suggestions that I thought were worth noting.

It's possible you may be able to reuse the drive motor to power the propeller, although it's difficult to give a more specific answer without knowing more about the RC car and airplane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As @JacobB notes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most RC cars use comparatively low voltage batteries (&lt;em&gt;2-3s&lt;/em&gt;) and have a spur and pinion gear to create the necessary torque.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And because many RC cars use brushed motors (&lt;em&gt;and the ones that are brushless have high Kv, like 4000 or 5000&lt;/em&gt;), having the motor attached directly to a propeller would likely result in either a severe lack of power and/or extremely inefficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Servos&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Servos are rated for how much deflection they can provide (&lt;em&gt;e.g. 45°, 90°, 180°, 360°, continuous/infinite rotation&lt;/em&gt;) and how much force/torque they can deliver. Again depending on the size of the aircraft you want to control, the servos you find in your RC car may be too small to control the aerodynamic surfaces of your plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aerodynamic surfaces on a plane can experience decently strong forces in-flight, so it's important to make sure your servos are appropriately sized and can maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditDate="2020-08-09T02:06:44.083" LastActivityDate="2020-08-09T02:06:44.083" CommentCount="7" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It also doesn't hurt that some of the STM32's turn out to actually have twice as much flash memory as they are supposed to.  Or that in most cases one of the SWD pins can be re-purposed as a serial UART, allowing experimental code to create debug output (channelling debug messages through SWD is also an option). Some of these MCUs also have flash security bugs which permit the original firmware to be backed up and restored; but decompilation is not really of any interest or benefit.

There are a few unique designs (eg, the Cypress stuff DSM uses) and the A7105 and then a lot of various clones and semi-compatibles of the nRF24L01+, of which the &amp;quot;backwards bit order&amp;quot; XN297 is probably the most famous.  These can typically be visually recognized, and there's already widespread knowledge of how to operate them from a replacement firmware.  While entirely possible by studying logic analyzer captures, often it's not necessary (or even desirable) to re-implement the toy's original air protocol, but rather preferable to implement one supported by the modifier's available hobby-grade transmitter - not infrequently, being able to use a hobby TX is a main point of putting a custom firmware on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEMS Gryo/Accelerometer chips are also limited in number.  While toys tend to feature chips with markings which which &amp;quot;don't exist&amp;quot; in the public catalog of the well-known makers, in practice examination of I2C bus traces tends to indicate that they are minor variations of parts with public data sheets.  Worst case, a re-implementor just sends the same setup sequences, and then performs the same repeating data query.  Tilting and twisting the drone with the logic analyzer hooked up and watching the live data display readily distinguishes which bitfields of the response encode which motion parameter.  PID tuning tends to be manually iterative, so there's no real need to put any actual &amp;quot;numbers&amp;quot; on the anything, just to distinguish the three acceleration and rotation axis and their format and sign.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor drivers are dead simple - FETs are readily recognized (and sometimes replaced with higher-spec versions).  A few drones with inverted flight capability have more complex H-bridge drive, but again this is not hard to figure out.  One cheap tiny platform had an odd set of connections running from the switched motor lead through a resistive divder to MCU ADC pins; it turned out that these were back-EMF monitors to detect spinning vs. blocked propellers during the PWM off time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="644" LastEditorUserId="644" LastEditDate="2020-08-09T20:16:16.937" LastActivityDate="2020-08-09T20:16:16.937" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Your current one is likely at the end of its life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My guess is that your battery is just old and has reached the end of its useful lifetime. The fully-charged capacity, and by extension flight time, of all batteries decreases over time when charged and discharged repeatedly. This process is sped along by pulling large amounts of current from the battery like what is sometimes necessary for multirotor flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your description of the slow charge rate after the battery reaches ~12V points to the battery being degraded. At 12V, a 3S battery pack is sitting at ~4.0V/cell. This means that the charger has likely entered the balance charging phase where it tries to equalize the voltage of all 3 cells in the pack and slowly bring them up to 4.2V/cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well-worn batteries will take longer in the balance charging phase because the internal resistances of each cell in the pack (&lt;em&gt;which generally increases during the battery's lifetime at different rates for each cell in the pack&lt;/em&gt;) are different, resulting in more energy and time that must be used to fully balance the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Increasing the Lifetime of a LiPo Battery&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although you mentioned that you're not really on a tight budget, you're probably interested in how you can make your next battery packs last longer. Here are some of the more common things that cause wear:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustained and peak current draw:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's generally an excellent idea to avoid drawing excessive amounts of current from a battery. Full throttle punches are fun and sound amazing, but do contribute to accelerating the degradation of the battery, so maybe don't do them as often. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charging beyond 4.2V/cell:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LiPo batteries shouldn't be charged beyond their full capacity of 4.20V/cell. Aside from increasing the risk of spontaneous combustion, the increased cell voltage puts extra strain on the internals of the battery, which accelerates battery degradation. It's true that some specific variants of LiPo have higher full-capacity voltages, like LiHv with ~4.25V/cell, but the vast majority of LiPo cells shouldn't be charged beyond 4.20V/cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not storing packs at ~1/2 capacity (~3.7-2.8V/cell) for extended periods of time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much like how over-charging LiPo batteries beyond their full charge level increases the internal strain on the pack, the same is true to a lesser extent for lower cell voltages over a long period of time. It's generally accepted that storing LiPo batteries at ~1/2 capacity, which translates to ~3.7-3.8V/cell, is safe and is a happy medium for minimizing battery degradation over a long period. If you plan on not flying your batteries for more than a few days, it's a good idea to run what's often called a &amp;quot;storage charge program&amp;quot; on your balance charger to charge/discharge your battery to ~3.7-3.8V/cell. Then recharge your batteries back to full as soon as is practical before flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draining a pack too far:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For normal use, permanent damage is caused to the battery if any of the cells drop below 3.0V/cell. Although as I mentioned previously, multirotors demand a lot from our batteries, so it's important that we try to keep the average cell voltage above ~3.4-3.6V during flight. This is because LiPo battery cell voltages drop off quite quickly below ~3.6V/cell, and so it's important to keep some margin to prevent any of the cell voltages from momentarily dipping below 3.0V before we can get the chance to land safely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastActivityDate="2020-08-12T18:38:57.380" CommentCount="7" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

They do not mention any CBO (community based organization) direction searching the site.  They are Oshkosh based, a legacy aviation mecca for stunt flight.  Their agenda is legacy (general) aviation and like the AOPA they are likely looking for money in a time of decline and diminishing interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding CBO and recreational flight in the USA (current), the AMA is the closest, but they are not a CBO (yet). The CBO regs and the recreational flight test are late (and required).  Per the way the regulations work, until this is settled all recreational RC flight is in a &amp;quot;non-legal&amp;quot; (and not not totally illegal) state. If you do not fly under a CBO you need to be commercial (generally speaking).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, in the USA the technical requirement for all non-commercial 250gram+ recreational flight is to be conducted in accordance with a CBO.

Your question is not really something anyone can objectively answer because you need to consider what your level of dedication to FPV is first. And of course rand loyalty is nothing short of a cult like relationship (#kiss)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Off the shelf &amp;quot;racing drones&amp;quot; don't exist.  The term &amp;quot;racing&amp;quot; is applied everywhere, but very few units will compete against real custom drones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A racing drone is a bad teacher I would not recommend that path for a first unit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First - you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; learn to fly FPV (rate/acro format) first, and a real racing drone with a high camera angle and a drivetrain for racing is a recipe for a bag of broken drone parts.  A mellow drone to learn on, including LoS (line of sight) is key.  Generally speaking the learning curve generates a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if you want an RTF &amp;quot;racing drone&amp;quot; buy one form GetFPV or a similar larger vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a pilot with over 10k flights and the distinct opportunity to coach and train many people on FPV flight over the years I highly recommend using a small repairable RTF and learning how to fly, land, gap, and not get hurt first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next is your level of dedication. To fly FPV effectively you need to be able to scratch build and repair.  Drones, especially racing units, break a lot and you need to have a pit crew (usually yourself).  Anything other than full dominion on your build is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The #1 problem in FPV is &amp;quot;going cheap&amp;quot;.  If budget is a concern walk away right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I DO NOT RACE but each of my 5&amp;quot; builds are similar in spec to a racing unit. Here are my operational costs as a dedicated FPV pilot.  Each 5&amp;quot; unit is $500-1200 in the air + my goggles (modded, high end) $700, controller (upgraded+customized) $500.  Batteries are minimum $40 per and I am lucky to get 20 solid flights before sag hits, then another 20-30 before retired. So $1/flight in battery, when I factor in other year to year decay it costs me about $2-3/flight.  I keep around 100 batteries active,  a minimum 10 is required for a typical session.  With the exception of new builds I spend about $200/month in upkeep for a modest fleet - comparable to any racer.  I mention this because the hobby (not a sport) is quite expensive, lots of breaks, tons of crap gear and advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to discourage you, but to race or fly with any serious intent is a legit commitment.  The #1 path to success is having a friend teach and support you.  I blew 3 ESCs on my first build's first power up - an experience like that is very common.  I buy motors in multiples of 5 because they go poof.  Everything I do is aimed to have high quality builds and minimal down time and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the learning curve - the path I suggest is getting the right controller first and connecting USB to a simulator.  If you ever bail, the transmitter will not loose a lot of value.  After that get a cheap $90 nano unit and learn to fly LoS, exercises like &amp;quot;walking the dog&amp;quot; for LoS flight will teach you how the drone reacts in the world, knowledge critical for safe and sustained FPV flight.  From there, grab either a nice RTF or start building.  5&amp;quot; drones are more expensive, but smaller units are a more difficult build from scratch. I consider 5&amp;quot; @500-700g AUW to be the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I may not be the norm, but despite an aviation background, all of my childhood and adult life playing video games, and having a lot of RC experience, FPV flight was very hard for me to master.  I made a lot of mistakes and my post here is intended to make you, or anyone, think about the reality of FPV.  There is a lot of peripheral gear and disposable elements plus a lot of breakage all the time (if racing or pushing the envelope). I knew the first time I saw FPV (via Trappy in 2012) that this was the hobby for the rest of my life.

The protocol for analogue radio was a 20ms packet, consisting of up to 9 pulses and a gap. So there were 10 things in a 20ms packet.

Any pulse longer than 2ms would overlap the pulse for the next channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously with digital radio, it's entirely possible to exceed this limit but I think it's unlikely that there will be an easy, built-in way to do it. Once you've set the end points as high as they'll go, I think that's all you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could use an Arduino to scale up the pulses you're getting from the receiver to the size you need for the servo. An Arduino Nano is a similar size and price to a servo, and easily able to handle that sort of task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However I think you'd be better to look at why your servo needs such a long pulse. Presumably it worked OK before you modified it, so it should be able to work from a standard pulse.

The problem is, that receiver is operating on different band and so it has some input filtering to not receive &amp;quot;out-of-band&amp;quot; signals, but no filtering is perfect and some receivers are better than others.&#xA;What happens is, that some energy gets through and adds to background noise but receiving signal still must be stronger to be picked up by receiver. So putting your RX close to your TX will effectively decrease your RX sensitivity (how weak signal can still be correctly received). That as said above depends on quality of RX AND sometimes also on quality of VTX as cheap ones may unexpectedly radiate signals well out of its band (and close to RX band).&#xA;To illustrate the situation, imagine yourself in a role of receiver - trying to hear someone very distant speaking to you while someone else is screaming right into you ear. I know, not precise as we miss input filtering there, but just as an approximation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To add example, I had experience with one 2.4 GHz RC RX, that was good to fly ~1km with no FPW gear and ground tests were showing promising 1.5km+ range. Adding 5.8 GHz VTX limited range to something around 200 m - quite a difference. But yes, that one was cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to separation of RX and TX by distance, you can use also the frame and or battery as an signal blocking obstacle with good advantage - you can place antennas so that something blocking the signal is right between them shielding RX one from TX one while both are still having clear line of sight with your ground-station. For example one being in the front facing up and the other one being in the back facing down - both sticking well out of frame, but being shielded from each other by the frame and battery inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="680" LastActivityDate="2020-08-24T11:51:44.027" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Buy a new battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I heavily researched this and although there may be another solution I will share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mavic batteries have complex circuitry in them to maintain stability and longevity.  This is partly why the Mavic charger will not revive the battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to manually charge it?  Well the answer is yes and no.   The cells inside the battery are probably okay if the battery did not deplete this far while in storage.  The problem is the circuitry will not allow a manual charge above failsafe levels restoring to a functioning DJI battery.   There are some videos and reports of people cracking open their batteries and doing various physical things to the circuitry to fix this issue.  I do not recommend this.  I found that opening the Mavic battery was not easy and left the battery case in disrepair due to it being glued or affixed with single use fasteners.  If there is a tool that can open the battery case gracefully i don’t believe it is something in a standard tool box.  On top of that the Mavic circuitry is precise to avoid radio interference and modding that could increase radio interference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the battery was open, poorly, I was able to charge directly to the main leads.  The battery stack read about 10.5 to 10.6 volts on 3 cells.  Very low.  My hobby charger pulled it up to 11.1 volts static.  I was still unable to charge using the Mavic charger.  This led me to believe the circuitry remembers the charge state of the battery and will not continue if that battery has inconsistent untracked voltage changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw another video that shows desoldering the positive terminal while the balance lines are disconnected.   Then soldering it back.  I tried this and it did seem to refresh the charge level readout, but i still could not charge using the Mavic charger.  With my battery split open and looking like it would never be allowed in checked or carry on baggage i gave up and decommissioned the battery using a method that worked for me.  Once the battery became inert it could be disposed of properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest contacting DJI before opening the case. Maybe they have a trade in policy or something when the Mavic depletes the battery too low?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best bet is to get a new battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="944" LastEditorUserId="944" LastEditDate="2020-09-02T06:32:58.960" LastActivityDate="2020-09-02T06:32:58.960" CommentCount="5" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

BLDC motors and drones are quite mechanically noisy environments with a lot of intense vibrations.

The issue may be that the intensity of the vibrations and/or force of the changing speed of the motor exceeds the practical limits of the threadlocker you're using.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We might be able to ascertain more about what's going on if we had images of the motor in question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastActivityDate="2020-09-04T17:26:06.990" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For example, drop solder on the top and let it &amp;quot;cast&amp;quot; into the head, then put electrical tape over it (not recommended, many reasons like motor may be off balance).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Copper braid or similar, just jam it up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Re-tap and get a new screw&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your problem is most probably a combination of these factors:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;heat&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;hot/cold expand and contract cycle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vibration&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;possible weakened threads (cut wide from friction).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trick is context, experience, knowing the tools and materials, and not buying cheap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now to the meat of the issue - BLDC motor, that is a broad designation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor&lt;/a&gt;), so you could be using an in- or out-runner. Big/low Kv versus smaller high Kv demands a different solution possibly. Each motor has a unique footprint on vibration, heat, operational range, expand/contract margins, etc.  So there are a number of factors that will help you decide what is best, I would contact the company if possible (probably Chinese and ZFG, but always an early consideration if possible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="868" LastEditorUserId="170" LastEditDate="2020-09-05T19:04:39.623" LastActivityDate="2020-09-05T19:04:39.623" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

A prototype I was working on last week had this problem. As I tightened the motor, the c-clip on the base was rubbing on the arm and slowing down. Loosen the screw and it spins faster. To check for this, take the motor off and spin it with your hand and get a feel for how much it will &amp;quot;free spin&amp;quot;. If you mount it and this &amp;quot;free spin&amp;quot; decreases then you want to look for friction.  Leave the leads disconnected when you are going to do this, as some motors will retain residual electricity and until drained they will spin slow (this is a false positive, so test everything unplugged)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking motors are built to be bolted down REALLY TIGHT, so there is probably operator error going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another very common problem is the mounting screw length.  There are 2 things I have run into related to mounting motors and screw length. First is the possibility that the screw is too long and is actually hitting something in the internals. If so, look for damage and/or compare amp draw with other motors, watch for higher heat, and be careful. The other more mystical problem is when the screw is too long, somewhat metallic or electromagnetic, and alters the magnetic field of the motor.  I have had his happen a few times and it is often not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that the motor and/or mount is warped. In this case, tightening can further disfigure or warp it and decrease performance.

A plus design generally will be arm first and will not crumble like an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; might. I don't fly plus because my crashes would be so much worse (50+mph cartwheels, fences,  buildings, you name it)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agree with @Robin Bennet, but that point is also moot in many scenario, especially FPV as the power to weight ratio is intense.  I have 5 inch drones that legitimately rotate in excess of 1000 degrees per second on pitch and roll.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The flight controller will need to know of the configuration of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; over plus is the rotational nature of the propellers.

Two props in the front pushing out has saved me from certain crash very often.  I switched about 3 years ago and I can say that recovery from bumps is vastly improved. I also note easier take off as well from a lawn, less instance of things getting tangled, plus my camera lenses are not chipped as much from sand reflections and ingestion because the props work more actively to not throw junk into the drone, prop-wash notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/D4Ci2.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/D4Ci2.png&quot; alt=&quot;propeller rotation reference&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end it is a preference, there are mild advantages to both but most to lean towards X for performance and logistical reasons.

To build a drivetrain, without years of experience, is very difficult, I doubt you will nail it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The approach you use to decide motor is critical, more on that as we progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some things to consider FIRST:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;what are your power train expectations? 10+:1 power:weight is what I use and my drone get's the hell out of town, but I also cook batteries; able to set them on fire punching out if I choose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is your desired type of flight, the spectrum goes from freestyle/race to sit-n-spin (hover and take photos).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What flight time would you like (short or long?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I am sure you know already, pitch and KV are related. High KV leans lower pitch (faster spin with blades that push less air). Low KV leans higher pitch (low KV should have more torque and allow steep pitch to push more air).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High KV build tend to have shorter flights but are more maneuverable.  Lower KV builds stay up longer and are amenable to cinematography (generally).  There are tuning specific problems across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of motors generally in &lt;code&gt;XXYY&lt;/code&gt; configuration vary greatly. &lt;code&gt;xx&lt;/code&gt; is the rotor diameter and &lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt; is the motor/rotor height.  Wider diameter motors have a different inertial footprint than narrow, carrying more weight to help keep the big props swinging.  Narrow can stop/accelerate/decelerate faster, again inertia is a big part of the formula.  Height of rotor is less impactful from my experience in the context of this discussion, generally a product of the diameter and desired KV (more height to wrap more wire, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A 2000kv motor [example] ranges from 15xx to 25xx sizes, so KV is a hard indicator to use alone.  KV is key for calculating the target max rotational speed in conjunction with your voltage.  I have used the exact same KV motors in a small and large format and the difference was astonishing.  The takeaway is that KV helps determine relative spin rate and is not helpful as a stand alone metric.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that rotational speed of the propellers is huge. Bigger slower moving props do not provide the same gyroscopic byproduct as a fast spinning motor, this may be something to consider.  There are all sorts of RPM specific problems along this spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On to props.  Generally props use a AABB format where &lt;code&gt;AA&lt;/code&gt; is the diameter and &lt;code&gt;BB&lt;/code&gt; is the pitch. Pitch, generally speaking, is how much &amp;quot;screw&amp;quot; the prop will move along the motor shaft axis per rotation.  When teaching new pilots I explain pitch as &amp;quot;how far a prop will move in a block of jello spinning 360 degrees&amp;quot;.  So a steep prop will move far while a shallow prop will not move very far [in this mental exercise].  A good internal understanding of pitch takes a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Battery choice is difficult.  Decision 1 is cell count (voltage). Decision 2 is mah (amount of energy stored) and generally an indicator of weight for the battery. Last is C rating (abuse factor). Mellow units can fly &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; on 25c, high performance need 75C+, my 5&amp;quot; cinema/chase drones need 95c+ (usually 120c).If you miss the C rating (too low) you will puff battery, decrease life dramatically, and generally be pretty upset with performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer your question, there are a few ways to go, but first you will need to have budget to fail and try again, that is the nature of scratch builds, especially for someone lacking extensive power train building experience.  Drone building is a constant repair cycle, that is why people who take this seriously travel with mirror+ builds, I usually carry 4+ units for a shoot or session.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The easy route is to buy a pre-built where payload and performance as well as demo videos are available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next route is to join a flying club or commercial group and check out other builds and get some local friends to guid the choice.  This is my #1 recommendation to new pilots - let a friend help. Otherwise you will be flailing in places like here listening to a lot of armchair pilots pushing their agenda and favorite builds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next approach is to copy a build that fits your needs. The largest repository of builds is RotorBuilds (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rotorbuilds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://rotorbuilds.com/&lt;/a&gt;), nice filters, tons of videos, and possibly contact info to ask questions directly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last way to go is take a stab at it. That is what I did in 2013, I failed and essentially smoked a whole drone worth of parts before my first flight. I copied Charpu's build (he was #1 at the time) and it was a painful experience without any coaching.  Granted times have changed, but the information on the web is mostly garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It feels safe to assume that you wanted XXYY motor and AABB prop on target voltage. I can't deliver than information, I doubt anyone without intimate knowledge of your use case will be much help.  Ergo, the approach and methodology to solving the problem becomes key.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DroneTrest has a good reference page (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dronetrest.com/t/brushless-motors-how-they-work-and-what-the-numbers-mean/564&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.dronetrest.com/t/brushless-motors-how-they-work-and-what-the-numbers-mean/564&lt;/a&gt;)  if you have not been here already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig in then seek out motor specification sheets.  There are many sites dedicated to this (I have no favorite).  Look at motor+volt+prop mah draw (avg/max) and heat if available.  This information is great, but unfortunately it will not help a lot without drivetrain building experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="868" LastActivityDate="2020-09-21T17:21:36.607" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It should have rings around the props to protect them and anything it hits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Syma, Eachine and Hubsan are popular brands but there are others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do get more than one battery. They typically only last about 5 minutes and take an hour to charge. A charger that can charge more than one battery at a time is a bonus too. That said, 10-20 minutes is enough for most people - at least after the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Headless mode' is quite a useful feature for beginners, it allows you to ignore yaw. Forwards is always 'away from you', whatever direction the drone is facing. It's not essential though, and can be confusing or lead to bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;'Altitude hold' should be useful but I've found these drones always need an experienced pilot to trim them first.

If you think this might be a problem, you can spend a bit more for a proper sized controller. There are various hacks for extending the sticks too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't buy one with a simple recording camera. Until you pay enough for one that can transmit the signal to you in real time, the footage will be rubbish because you can't point the camera and frame the shot. The first time you do it, it's cool to see a blurry, poorly coloured picture from the air but the novelty quickly wears off. View your first drone as a trainer and indoor toy that will take the knocks of learning while you save up for something better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't bother buying loads of spares, these little things don't break very often, and it's as likely to be a motor burning out as a broken prop, and a pack of spare motors can cost more than the drone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, they are very prone to picking up stray hairs and winding them around the props and motors. Try not to spend all your time bumping around on the floor, and check for hairs after each crash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're learning, try to pop up into a hover a foot or so off the ground and concentrate on holding the right height. When it has drifted half-way to an obstruction, cut the power and land. Don't try to fight it because you'll just crash harder. Put it back in the middle of the room, review what you should have done and try again. When you can control the height, try correcting the drift but still land and review when it gets half-way to an obstruction. If you struggle, find a larger space to practice for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastActivityDate="2020-09-29T09:17:18.220" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

These drones are nothing compared to either DJI or an FPV drone. I say it as it is. And I'm usually the guy who saves on every penny possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had a Revell Nano Hex and a Carrera drone, each around 30€. Both are completely unable to hold their position or anything. These drones just end up frustrating the operator. Also, the batteries on both wore out crazily fast (&amp;lt;20 flights until only around 60-70% of flight time was left). When I started up my DJI P3S, it was a completely different feeling. Nothing like I was used to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is: cheap toy drones are not representative. There might be good quality ones, but event these are completely different in their functionality than DJI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DJI/Ryze have the Tello drone. I've flown that a couple of times and it seemed pretty stable in the air - that is a good practice drone when your brothers want to get into &amp;quot;Camera first&amp;quot; drones. But, this drone is not cheap at 90-120€.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Headless mode is pretty much non-existent at these lower cost drones and I'd also say it's nothing necessary. I've used it only once or twice with my Phantom in 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Altitude hold is the thing you should be after at a beginner drone. Drones with altitude hold won't shut their motor off when you pull down the throttle - instead they go into a controlled descent.

These drones have little to no price degradation so they'll be equally as inexpensive as cheap toy drones, while preventing frustration due to crashes. Bear in mind, there's a DJI announcement coming up, where they're expected to launch a Mavic Mini 2.

The DJI drones' long flight times are largely due to the high capacity batteries, motors, and propellers used.&lt;/strong&gt; Although, there are many smaller &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/528/what-affects-the-total-flight-time-for-a-drone&quot;&gt;things that also affect flight times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most significant of these is the battery. A typical &amp;quot;FPV drone&amp;quot; uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogershobbycenter.com/lipoguide&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;LiPo battery&lt;/a&gt; with a relatively low capacity and relatively low-quality cells in order to reduce the all-up-weight and cost. DJI uses more expensive LiPo cells that have a higher energy capacity per weight. The DJI batteries have noticeably more capacity, but they are heavier and quite expensive making them less than desirable for usual FPV flights because batteries are often destroyed in a crash. However, you certainly could use these very high quality battery cells on an FPV drone if you wanted longer flights. Another way that some FPV pilots can get longer flights without spending too much is by using Li-ion battery packs. They cannot deliver nearly as much current nor are they as durable, but they store a lot of energy and normally can get 20-30 minutes of flight time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many FPV pilots who custom build Li-ion packs out of 18650 cells or buy pre-built Li-ion packs to get longer flight times. One FPV drone I can think of that works well with Li-ion is the Flywoo Explorer LR. I've seen people getting ~40 minutes of flight time with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other big things that contribute to the DJI drones' long flight times is the type of motors and propellers used. Drones that are designed for long flight times, like DJI drones, or some long range FPV drones, have motors with less powerful magnets or a wider air gap between the stator and magnets which results in more energy efficient operation. High performance motors, which are seen on most FPV drones, have very powerful magnets and tiny air gaps to increase performance and torque at the expense of some efficiency. As for propellers, when you look at drones designed for long flight time, you see two blades, low pitch, and longer blades. But when you look at High performance FPV drones, you see steeper pitch, more (usually three) blades, and shorter blades so that the motors can change the prop speed faster. More blades on a propeller usually decreases efficiency but increases stability. Having blades with higher pitch increases the consumption of current, so a lower pitch is often more energy-efficient. And the size of propeller also makes a significant impact as &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/961/why-are-larger-propellers-generally-more-efficient-than-smaller-ones&quot;&gt;larger propellers are more efficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of factors that impact the flight time of drones.

Photography drones (such as DJI) use large rotors and exploit that efficiency for duration. Race drones use smaller rotors because they want to go as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other factor is that photography drones typically carry larger batteries for longer duration, while race drones want to keep their weight down for maximum agility and acceleration. A photography drone will fly so long as it can produce more thrust than its weight, typically they have less than a 2:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and can't maintain altitude when angled more than 45 degrees from horizontal. Race drones can have a 10:1 thrust to weight ratio, and commonly fly at pretty extreme angles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So long as a race drone has enough duration to complete the race, any extra battery capacity is just dead weight, slowing it down.

Foam board is a 5mm thick non-beaded polystyrene foam sheet with a layer of paper on either side for added strength. You can buy sheets from craft stores for a dollar or two.  It's easy to cut with a sharp knife (small box cutters are ideal) and it can be glued with hot glue or UHU POR (but some other adhesives will melt the foam). The paper layer makes it easy to paint, with almost any paint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can build a good starter plane with two or three sheets of foam, and with practice it only takes an afternoon or so. Your first attempt may be a bit scruffy but you will get better with practice, so plan to make several. Smallish, light models are fairly tough and easy to patch up, but knowing you can completely rebuild for very little cost is a huge confidence boost and will help avoid the common story of buying an expensive model from a shop, crashing on your first flight and giving up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Download and print out a 3-view drawing of your favourite plane and stick it to the foam. Cut out a profile of the fuselage, and the plan view of the wings and tail. Stick them together, add some nose weight so it balances about 25% from the front of the wing and it will probably fly. Experiment with the nose weight, the angle of the tail and dihedral. You'll also learn a lot about the location and weather required for flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next find a plan for a beginner RC plane in foam board, such as the FliteTest Tiny Trainer, Simple Cub or Scout. These models are relatively light and simple, and all have the wings angled up (called dihedral) which causes them to self-level, vastly increasing your chances of success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These all have free plans under the 'resources' tab in their shop. Print them out, lightly glue the paper to the board and cut them out. Feel free to simplify the shapes slightly as they were drawn for a laser cutter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now for the electronics. There are some toy planes under $20 that are quite fun for a 10-year old under adult supervision but they're quite limited and not a good way to start the hobby. You don't have much control and they're very slow, so will blow down wind. You also can't reuse the gear in anything else so they're not a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A basic radio will cost at least \$30, but you'll want to upgrade that within a year so it's not really a good investment. For \$40 you can get a cheap computer radio with multiple model memories (for when you have more than one plane) and channel mixes (for flying wings, deltas, V-tails or flaps) - that's all the features you really need for a lifetime in the hobby. Most people will spend more for a 'nice' transmitter, but you don't need to. Transmitters generally come with a receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recommended sizes for the various bits are listed with the plans. You'll need to do a bit of research to work out what all the numbers mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next you'll need a motor and Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). These are \$5-10 each.  You will break props, so get some spares.&#xA;9 gram servos are about \$3 each. You'll need 2 initially, but it's worth having a couple of spares for crashes or more complex models.&#xA;You'll need multiple batteries, as flights are typically 10 minutes or so.&#xA;Basic chargers start at about \$20. Get one that can handle a range of sizes and cell counts, and it'll last you for years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You won't get that lot for \$50 but you should manage to keep it under \$100. I suppose the stuff that's in the plane should be under \$50, as the expensive bits are the transmitter, charger and spare batteries!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the gear can be used on multiple models. When one gets too damaged, or you want to try something new, just move the gear across. The transmitter, charger and batteries can all be shared between multiple models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's worth shopping around a bit but avoid anything that's super cheap with no reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastEditorUserId="124" LastEditDate="2020-10-06T08:17:14.147" LastActivityDate="2020-10-06T08:17:14.147" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

If you go for a tube an plate design I believe a top wing is more stable then a bottom wing as the weight hangs below the wing and tends to &amp;quot;self right&amp;quot; which translates to an easier learning experience. Definitely aim for something that flies slowly, and has largish control surfaces; you can usually soften the responsiveness in the controller settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pusher configurations seem better then puller configurations as the propeller is less likely to snap when in the back then in the front. Also motor shafts readily bend in collisions and are pain to bend straight again (Pressing on two chucks mounted on each end of the bend in the shaft seem the easiest means of doing this). If you do go for something with a front facing propeller make sure that the propeller is protected by the recess between the nose and the wing (Touch the nose and wing tip to a flat surface and be sure that the propeller doesn't make contact as well).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Foam is surprisingly durable and can sustain repeated rips, tears and repairs. A strip of duct tape along the leading edge will protect it in heavier crashes and collisions with pointy things like sticks. Mine has two carbon ribs that run almost from wing tip to wing tip which are surprisingly handy as you can press a ripped wing together, tape up the tear with some masking tape and go for a few extra flights each session; I tend to keep flying until the rip gets to these ribs as it's easier to repair a complete rip then a partial one. If you do go the balsa route building something out of solid balsa, rather then a finnicky ribbed construction, then I'd add a strip of foam along the leading edges for shock absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you build yours make sure that all the wires are tucked within the body. Any loops of wire that hang loose will snag on trees, fences, rough bush and rocks and you will have to get thrifty with the soldering iron. Protect your control rods as well with a bit of raised plastic or balsa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Radio Setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you setup your radio check in the menus if you can setup a kill switch for the engine it'll save a propeller here and there and makes it easier to learn as you just toggle the switch when you're about to hit something. Not having a tail also saves you learning an extra control input right out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Model Setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you start flying make sure that the model is well balanced, usually it should pivot about the widest point of the wing. I usually throw mine into a patch of tall grass a few times making sure that it glides fairly straight. If it rotates or veers left or right check that the flaps/ailerons/flaperons are inline with one another. If it bobs up and down check that it isn't nose or tail heavy (Tail heavy is worse it seems) and that the control surfaces aren't too high/low. Ideally it should glide level and straight with a slight down angle making a triangle from where you released it and where it contacts the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Flying&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the model is setup try for unpowered glides, throwing down wind gives you a good glide and builds confidence but limits maneuverability since the wing has limited lift. Throwing into the wind you can point it high and glide it in place and give a good feel for it's reactivity under power. Once you're comfortable with this add power and try for  long straight flights, get used to fighting cross winds and any disturbances then work up to lazy S curves and aim for figures of 8. After that you can start with the fancy things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Aside&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My initial setup was/is quite under powered so I didn't know if it would actually fly until the fifth or sixth session when I finally got a good glide or two and had worked out what the heck I was doing; mostly for the plane to climb it had to be dead level at full power, a slight nose up was ok too but anything more then 5-10 degree up and it would sink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have let family members and any one walking past showing the slightest interest have a bash and reckon one needs about 200-300 crashes to get flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first 50-100 flights, with flight times of 5-15 seconds gets the control down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The next 100-200 flights, with flight times of 15-30 seconds, one can start transitioning to powered flight&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 200-300 thereafter, with flight times of 30 seconds to a few minutes, one gets comfortable with it flying back at you and across your view.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My second setup was overpowered and I would not recommend that as a starter either as you'll smash into the countryside faster and need more glue; granted an overpowered plane has more near misses then collisions once you get the control down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I'm quite inclined to recommend discus launch gliders as the first planes to try since the get high quite quickly and let you have more time to learn the controls initially.

My experience has been that it takes around 200-300 flights before you can hold a figure 8 pattern. It seems that the initial flights are the largest learning block since the flights are quite short and the window for learning the smallest as the person gets longer flights in they tend to learn quicker. Roughly the learning curve goes as follows :&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first 50-100 flights, with flight times of 5-15 seconds, one gets the control down (Dive, climb, left and right).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The next 100-200 flights, with flight times of 15-30 seconds, one can start transitioning to powered flight.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 200-300 thereafter, with flight times of 30 seconds to a few minutes, one gets comfortable with it flying back at you and across your view.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Basis&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general claim is that a slow flying, top wing is best for learning but I have had fair success with a flying wing.

However small models are a lot more robust in a crash. and cheaper, so less discouraging when you crash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly stable models return the model to straight and level flight but neutrally stable models (like a flying wing) are less affected by gusts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this leave you with the option of a small, stable model and waiting patiently for calm weather, or a faster, less stable model and an instructor (or lots of crashes and repairs!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days it's possible to use electronic stabilisation to tame a neutrally stable aircraft, and to reduce the effect of gusts on a small model (although it won't stop it disappearing down wind!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IME it takes an hour or two (on a simulator, or accumulated flight time) before a beginner can keep a model under control and steer the right way when it's flying towards them. Most people can only concentrate for 5-10 minutes at a time, so that's 10-20 flights (on a reasonably stable trainer, suitable weather and an instructor avoiding crashes). It then takes few months to a year before progressing on to an aileron model that isn't stable in roll - maybe 10 hours of flight time, say 100 flights of 5-10 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously if you don't have an instructor and are just doing short glides, those first couple of hours will translate to a lot of flights.

The pitch of a prop is how far it will advance in one rotation if there's no slip, so a 5&amp;quot; pitch prop spinning at 15,000rpm will advance 75,000 inches per minute, or about 70mph. That means that when your plane reaches 70mph, the prop cannot produce any thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, exactly how much thrust is required to reach any particular speed is very hard to estimate, and how thrust drops off with speed is also hard to estimate, but it's safe to say that the above plane will have a top (level) speed of under 70mph.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to look at the recommended prop for your motor. Often it will say something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.electricwingman.com/sunnysky-x2206-1500kv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use on 2s with 9×4.7 slow fly or the GWS 9×5 direct drive propellers.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Can also be used on 3s with 8×4 or 7×3.5 propellers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see how increasing battery voltage spins the prop faster and requires a smaller prop to keep the power within the motor's limits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A larger, lower-pitch prop (or a smaller, high-pitch prop) will have roughly the same power requirements. The normal rule of thumb is to add an inch of diameter when you reduce the pitch by an inch, or the other way around. So if a motor can handle an 8x4, it could also handle 9x3, 7x5 or 6x6.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The larger prop will have more thrust, but the smaller, higher-pitch prop will have a higher pitch speed, and thus a higher maximum possible speed. Prop pitch is a lot like gears on a car of bicycle. Too low and the top speed will be very limited, too high and it'll be hard to get going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you need to go back to rules-of-thumb. Props are made in a range of sizes that are useful for most models. Generally the highest pitch option is the same as the diameter (a so-called 'square prop') and is only useful to very fast, sleek models like pylon racers. Models with more drag will need more thrust, and won't need the high pitch speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that motor, you'd use the following props on these types of model:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;6x6 - pylon racer.&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;7x5 - 'sports' aerobatics or flying wing&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;8x4 - trainer&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;9x3 - 3D aerobatics (i.e. prop-hanging) or slow 'vintage' flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the same proportions for other motors: a 'square' prop for speed, diameter = 2 * pitch for a trainer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure, order a prop either side of what you think the ideal will be and see which you prefer. Props are relatively cheap and you'll probably need replacements at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally you should also test a new motor/prop combination on the bench with a Watt-Meter, so check it's not pulling more current than recommended (or the ESC can handle) but you can also just check how warm the motor gets when run for 30 seconds or a minute. Warm is fine, but if the motor gets hot, you'll have to be careful in the air until you're sure the extra airflow is enough to keep it cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastActivityDate="2020-10-07T11:44:42.710" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's also possible to rewrite the control software to limit the available acceleration, thus forcing smooth, &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; flight.

I use a punch and &amp;quot;auto-rotate&amp;quot; on drones to limp back to the launch site when the battery is low (via FPV and rate controls not available on most drones).  This is accomplished via &amp;quot;active braking&amp;quot; (or any other name scraped up) - in short the motors can turn into mini alternators and feed voltage back into the system, used to slow down props for key maneuvers. I have pulled some miracle landings using this dangerous method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Capacitors are similar to batteries except they have 2 big differences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1: Caps can not hold a charge for long (seconds or minutes)&#xA;2: Caps can discharge really fast - as in instantly.

Problems are many, here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proximity is an issue - inductive &amp;quot;wireless&amp;quot; charging requires things to be pretty close (inch or less generally).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Right now it is far too difficult to get enough power unless you transform the use. One can trickle charge a phone because a typical iPhone under load is ~500mah draw (tiny).  A drone is many, or tens of, amps hovering so you would need to exit the trickle charging &amp;quot;wifi&amp;quot; approach and lean towards directed energy (beam focusing), such as microwave (type of energy).  You would also need to change the power reception and conversion on unit.  Wireless power still eludes science for any practical use where power is high and range is preferred, even at only a few feet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can not underscore enough how poor wifi efficiency is currently. Claims of 60-75% are lab results - I have run tests on my chargers and I am quite unimpressed in performance. Convenience is high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Danger is real - my wifi chargers all suggest NOT sleeping with the charger near bed or a minimum 20cm distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is always important to underscore how drones are generally at peak technology.

Drones are fixed prop and that mechanical difference alone places the devices in a unique category.  The actual differences are many.  It should also be mentioned that &amp;quot;drone&amp;quot; covers a wide range of devices, the proper term would be multirotor or specifically fixed prop multirotor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They cannot glide&amp;quot;: False, I limp back using glide and auto-rotation type skills to inductively charge the battery and coast.  Gliding is totally possible with low RPM for stability. Not the same as a powerless glide, but similar in the sense of floating on a cushion.  Propellers during forward flight can offer lift, just like a heli.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;most drones move in very straight lines, of same altitude, with sharp turns&amp;quot;: Not at all.  My speciality is plane like flight.  I have burnt at least 2000 flights doing controlled figure 8 bank turns to master the style. I only do abrupt turns as needed, otherwise I seek flow where planes and birds are my inspiration. Indeed, many of my flights are essentially identical to wing flight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;results in quite unnatural &amp;quot;flight experience&amp;quot;&amp;quot;: What is natural?  Or, more to the point, natural is totally subjective based on the experience of the individual.  My flights I consider very natural in the vein of how I would fly if you gave me a high performance hovercraft. A heli flight is natural to a heli pilot while a glider flight is natural to a pilot of that craft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;any drones which would be able to simulate a more &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; flying experience&amp;quot;:  YES, first understand that most of the experience is the skill of the pilot.  A racer will not necessarily have chops for complex long multi-axes maneuvers (I can't slam gates very well FWIW).  RotorX played with a hybrid glider/FPV drone - I don't think it ever got off the ground (I saw testing footage a few years ago).  Andy Shen (ShenDrones) had an old unit he would bring to the field that was very &amp;quot;aircraft like&amp;quot; in flight with mixed props, custom mix controls, and hit 90mph (in NYC fields - that was fun).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are there such drones which are capable of this,&amp;quot;: Again, look to the pilot more than anything.  I am quite capable of long parabolic turns on almost any drone provided the rate, expo, and tune permits. Additionally, most FPV drones (my overwhelming speciality) fly in &amp;quot;rate&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;acro&amp;quot; where the control is raw (no stabilization, no auto level, no GPS, no guidance, only orientation and throttle). These types of flight provide full dominion over orientation as well as thrust, as a result the style of flight is trivial for skilled pilot/mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will concede that true gliding, be it a variation of helicopter autorotation or controlled no-thrust glides, are generally not possible using a drone.  We get close, and in many circumstances props, even at low RPM, do perform similar to a wing. We reserve the potential to dip into this behavior, it is not central to the flight paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A last note, harkening back to Andy Shen's drone I referenced.  He used custom mix controls to facilitate the flights.  Mix controls (if used) along with rate, expo, and tune are the determining factors for how a flight performs. Racing demands a certain type of tune for sharp turns, rapid reversal, and low-to-ground flight.  Beyond configuration, there are MANY experimental drones out there operating in a hybrid manner a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aforementioned RotorX unit, talk to them&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Stingray 500 by Curtis Youngblood could in theory autorotate and glide.

By looking at the new generation of Mosfets used in ESC, I see junction to case thermal resistances around 51°C/W (°C per &amp;quot;thermal&amp;quot; watts) and Rdson around 2.9mOhms. With some ESCs specified for 40Amps max current, you could have with conductions losses only (so not taking into account switching losses) - something around Pdissipated_conduction = Rdson * I² = 2.9[mOhm] * 40[A]² = 4.6 Watts (thermal) -&amp;gt; therefore if you'd use only two of these mosfet for your H-bridge (one top side, one bottom side) you'd reach 231°C on each if no heatsink is used (anything above 100°C is not recommendable as Silicon semiconductors will melt at approx 125°C and of course, the casing must be able to withstand the heat as well without melting, of course)... So, it depends on the number of parallel branches of your hbridge (number of MOSFETs/2) on your ESC for dividing/spreading the thermal load and if there is an heatsink or not -&amp;gt; an heatsink would make the ensemble have much lower thermal resistance than 51°C/W, cumulatively you'd reach something around 10°C/W if you choose your passive heatsink wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A word to the wise: if you're planning on putting an heatsink to your esc, you'll have, as it was written previously in the comments, to remove the insulation. But on some MOSFETs there is a metallic heatpad on top, made especially to conduct heat from the Source or drain of the MOSFET - so electrically connected! You ought to use a silicon interface pad or adhesive instead of silicon paste as the paste might not be evenly spread and shortcircuits might be achieved if something is touching the heatsink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if it's on the consumer market or not, but purchasing something with SiC mosfets (Silicon carbide mosfet) would allow you to go to temperatures much much higher than 100°C if you want to make a beast people will remember haha - but then you'd have to be very clever about your mechanical arrangement - going metal?- so it doesn't melt + the printed circuit board would have to be Polyimide and not FR-4 substrate in order to avoid delamination... and yeah - this wouldn't be a drone for the kids, or you'd have to teach them not to touch it before it cools when it comes back from Hyperspace&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1159" LastActivityDate="2020-10-27T18:19:46.717" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Another theory is of mine is that the OSD chip will just give up when it doesn't receive what it expects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the signal finally comes to the VTX the ground potential is the same as the cameras, and the signal will be correct again (possibly with some unnoticeable noise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*For example: imagine that the camera sends out a signal of 0.6 V. If the potential of the OSD chips ground is 0.1 V lower than that of the camera, it will interpret the signal as being 0.6 - (-0.1) = 0.7 volts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that this is just my (relatively) qualified guess, and you would probably have to measure the signals and know how the OSD chip works to know exactly what is going on.

As you mention, planes can fly with a fairly low thrust to weight ratio. Obviously gliders can fly with no power at all, so there's no critical lower-limit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that pitch-speed is important - the prop needs to be producing thrust when the plane is moving, not stationary. Measuring static thrust only tells you half the story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of thrust, it's better to look at power. Assuming that your motor and prop are reasonably efficient (and most are) measure the power going into the motor with a watt meter (or run it for a minute and see how much energy your charger puts back into the battery). Then weigh the complete model, including the battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;50 w/lb is about the minimum for gentle cruising and slow climbs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 W/lb is 'sporty', say for a warbird. You don't have to worry about conserving energy and can easily climb out of trouble. It might not have unlimited vertical climb though.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;200 W/lb is unlimited vertical climb, hovering and climbing vertically out of the hover.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For ducted fans, you should double these numbers. i.e. at 100 w/lb you'll need to be careful to conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However foam board planes aren't super-efficient or super-fast, so you can usually do a simple thrust test to check it'll be OK. Dangle it by a wing tip and gradually apply power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the model has enough power to support its own weight, it's probably around 100 w/lb&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If it can only reach about 45 degrees, its about 50 w/lb and will fly if you're careful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About pitch speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a prop has 6&amp;quot; of pitch and is turning at 1000rpm, under no load it would advance 6000 inches per minute.

For example - I totally reverse engineered and hacked a 6e only to find out that travel of the potentiometers beyond certain values would reset the position to 0/middle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Telemetry is optional and expensive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technology used by Spektrum is plane-centric.

I met that team and spent some time with them - they are in it to win it. Spektrum is part of a large conglomerate that is tied up with a lot of dirty stuff.

The kinematics of a fixed-wing airplane require it to bank in order to maintain coordinated flight. This is going to cause gyroscopic precession, which will result in time-varying flight characteristics. In particular, those flight characteristics will depend on the maneuvers which you did earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr /&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Explanation&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there were a large reaction wheel, sufficient to alter the plane's attitude, then there would be an associated large moment of inertia for the reaction wheel. This makes intuitive sense, since if the reaction wheel is going to twist hard on the plane, the plane is going to twist hard on the reaction wheel. The driving equation is &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$T=I \alpha_{wheel}$&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actual rotational inertia would be a function of rotational velocity, &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$J=I \omega_{wheel}$&lt;/span&gt;. So as we accelerate the reaction wheel, we build inertia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have an object spinning about the plane's z-axis, but we want to bank about it's x-axis. That's going to cause some gyroscopic precession torques, with the magnitude depending on the reaction wheel's current speed, &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$`T_{precession} = J \omega_{roll}$&lt;/span&gt;, and with the direction depending on the sign of the bank and reaction wheel spin direction. These torques appear in the pitch axis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in other words, the way a plane pitches as a response to a bank input will vary in function of how fast the wheel is spinning, as well as which direction the wheel is spinning. If the plane just completed a long 360 degree turn to the left and then wants to bank right, we can be certain that there will be a very different response from if the plane wants to bank right after a 5 degree right turn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible solution to this problem is to use a reaction wheel to reduce the size of the control surfaces. The reaction wheel could give short, fast control responses with the control surfaces giving slow, long control responses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of anyone who has tried this. It might be best on a flying wing of  some kind because of the large body which could house a large wheel.

(There are some new technologies that use a digital bus to control the servos, but this is still less common.)&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Some models do not have three axis control, so just don't install those servos ... and some (normally larger) designs have multiple servos per surface to provide enough force so just double them up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When choosing a radio kit, you will want to look at the number of 'channels' it has. Four is typical (throttle, pitch, roll, yaw) but it is worth thinking about if you may want more in the future (e.g. flaps) as if your budget allows, it might be better value to spend a little more at the start than getting new kit later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdP1u.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LdP1u.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastActivityDate="2020-11-18T09:09:32.403" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It supplies power directly to the motors, and its BEC supplies power to the receiver and servos. The ESC has a Futaba JR connector with Ground, 5V, and Signal that plugs into the receiver.

The wires from ESCs are often labelled, but if not, there will be two big wires on one end that are the input from the battery (red for positive, black for negative), and three big wires on the other end that supply the motor. The motor wires can be any colour and it doesn't really matter how you connect them. If the motor runs backwards, switch any two motor wires. The cable to the receiver will be three wires joined together in a ribbon, similar to the cable on servos (and with the same plug)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ESC also provides 5v to power the receiver and servos. All the positive and negative pins in the receiver are connected. The part of the ESC that does this is known as a BEC or 'battery eliminator circuit' because 'back in the day' you needed a separate 5v battery for the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Servo cables have three wires, positive, negative and signal. Positive is in the middle so that plugging it in backwards doesn't cause short circuit. Servo plugs are pretty standard, although some have a little tab on one side to prevent them being reversed - but this requires that the receiver has a slot for the tab (and many don't, and the tabs get cut off).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Servo plugs are small and need a special crimp tool to make, so they are nearly always done for you - and they all use the same pins, so different brands are compatible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also want plugs to connect the motor and ESC, either because the design routes the motor wires through the firewall, or so you can move components between models. 3.5mm bullet connectors are pretty standard here, with the male plugs on the motor (so you can safely power up an ESC without a motor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you shop carefully, you can probably find an ESC and motor with all the relevant plugs already attached but many only have the servo plug, either to reduce cost or to provide you with more choice. If it comes without plugs, or you need to change a plug, you will need to solder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Tiny Trainer is just about able to use the little red JST battery plugs that use the same pins as servo plugs, but it's right at the limit and old plugs tend to overheat, melt and short circuit. XT30 plugs would be a safer choice. XT60 plugs are much bigger than you need but a common standard for chargers and larger models. There are lots of other types of plugs these are the most common now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beware that the connectors such as the motor plugs or XT60 battery plugs require a larger soldering iron than the 20w irons that are usually sold for hobby electronics. Also, if you're soldering, you'll need some heat shrink tube to cover the joint. 5mm diameter fits XT60s and 3.5mm motor plugs. Remember to put the tube on the wire before you solder the joint, and slide it away from the heat or it'll shrink before you are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky enough to have a local hobby shop, they are usually very helpful in finding parts that will work together. Take a list of the recommended gear and they'll find equivalents, and may even do the soldering for a small fee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're in the hobby shop, buy some spare props, some piano wire for the pushrods, control horns and swing keepers to make the attaching the push rods easier, and some Velcro strap to hold the battery in place.

If you have the motor at maximum the whole time then you will run out of battery pretty fast. Keeping the motor at full for too long is also a good way to damage electronics. If you keep the throttle lower, the motor will use less electricity in a given amount of time but it will also provide less thrust. As the thrust decreases, the plane will go slower and have reduced climbing ability. If the plane goes too slow then it won't be able generate enough lift to stay in the air. I believe that the transmitter throttle channel changes what percentage of power available goes to the motor. This last part is speculation and is probably partly wrong.

The voltage is determined by the number of battery cells connected in series. So 3s = 11.1V and 4s = 14.8V. For your drone I would recommend 3s because the ESC may not be able to handle a higher voltage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Capacity: Capacity is measured in mAh (milliamp hour). More capacity means more power that can be used by the drone, but also heavier. It's best to balance this so that you have enough power for a decently long flight but not so heavy that the drone can't fly. For the size of that drone, 1300mAh - 2200mAh should work well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Type: Most drones use LiPo batteries. LiPo batteries are used because of their great power to weight ratio. LiPo would be the best for your drone. There are, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.stackexchange.com/questions/242/alternatives-to-lipo-batteries&quot;&gt;alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="170" LastActivityDate="2020-11-21T21:10:23.137" CommentCount="1" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's so fast that the motor just sees it as a varying voltage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you cut a piece of card and stuck it on the transmitter to prevent full throttle being used, the speed controller would only run the motor at partial power. The car would accelerate more slowly, have a lower top speed and the battery should last longer. It should break less when you crash too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, voltage supplied to the motor is only part of the story. The current drawn from the battery is what's actually important, as battery capacity is measured in Amp-Hours (i.e. a 1AH battery can supply 1 amp for an hour, or 2 amps for half an hour, etc). The current decreases as the motor speed increases. A motor running at full throttle with no load will spin quickly but draw little current but the same motor struggling through grass will be running more slowly and drawing more power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you want longer run time, drive on a smoother, lower-grip surface or change gear ratio to a lower gear so the motor can reach its top speed with less power.

If this test is with only one motor (I assume it is, correct me if I'm wrong) that seems like a lot, considering that my drones draw about that much in total (4 motors + VTX, camera etc.) during flight. The voltage is about the same as my drones (4S), so that would result in a much higher power draw (About 9600 W vs. 2400 W).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could someone help me figure out what is correct?

High peak current draw is one of the reasons why drone battery leads are 12 AWG. Although, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miniquadtestbench.com/assets/components/motordata/motorinfo.php?uid=259&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MQTB motor test&lt;/a&gt; you're looking at is a fairly synthetic test that isn't 100% representative of what you'd see on an actual multirotor drone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The astronomical current figures at roughly &amp;gt;2/3 throttle aren't that common to see in a given flight. High throttle punches are usually a small percentage of total flight time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When the current draw gets too high, the internal resistance of the battery causes voltage sag that tempers/lowers power output. You can think of this as a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;negative feedback loop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The peak figures he cites are almost certainly &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; transient affairs, like for example when the motor initially starts from a stagnant state and requires a bunch of juice for a fraction of a second. I haven't tested this myself, but I'm fairly confident that peak current draw over a more reasonably long period of time would be a lot lower.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, peak current draw during a flight can still be quite high. Once well-calibrated, the current sensor on many flight controllers can paint a rather flattering picture of total current draw, sometimes showing hovering in the ~20-50A range and peaks in the ~100-150A range during punch-outs for reasonably powerful setups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastActivityDate="2020-12-02T19:11:38.737" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It's typical for permanent magnet motors to have a 'stall current' that's several times higher than the normal current at their maximum power speed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most 5&amp;quot; FPV quads use 30 or 40amp speed controllers on each motor. These would melt and catch fire at 150Amps unless it's only for a tiny fraction of a second. Motors, wires and battery plugs have a fair bit of mass to them, and can absorb the heat from being overloaded for a few seconds or even a few minutes. The solder connections and circuit board traces in an ESC do not, and overheat very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 'average' column in those tables looks like the average current for a motor at full throttle on a test stand in stationary air, not the average current during flight. You don't use full power very often, or for long, and as the quad flies faster the motors don't have to work as hard to pull air into the props.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The proof of that is that a typical 1500mAh battery typically lasts 3-4 minutes (and we aim to leave 20-30% capacity in the battery for maximum lifetime). A 3 minute flight is a 20c discharge (30amp average). A 4 minute flight plus 25% safety margin is only 12c, which gives an average current of 1.5A * 12 = 18amps - and that's the total for all four motors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FPV batteries need to be able to handle short spikes of power, up to the maximum of the speed controllers, but most of the time they're not working all that hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="124" LastActivityDate="2020-12-03T08:40:04.200" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I have fixed the drone to the setup and basically trying to test pitch correction by feeding a desired pitch angle and current pitch angle from IMU. The AHRS code uses Mahony filter to fuse the sensor data from Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. When I start my testing and spin the motors, can see the current pitch angle varying (or Oscillating). When I test without spinning the motors, the pitch angle is much precise. I observed that when the motors spin, a lot of vibration is generated and i doubt this is affecting the sensor to result in inaccurate output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How can the vibration effect be nullified on the IMU sensor?

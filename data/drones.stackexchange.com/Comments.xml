The problem is a function of the PID controller, not a function of Airmode. In fact Airmode is technically not a mode, it's the disabling of a &quot;feature&quot; that was programmed into early firmwares that prevented the PID controller from taking full effect at low throttle in order to prevent spazzing out on takeoff and landing or low-throttle bumps for beginners.
